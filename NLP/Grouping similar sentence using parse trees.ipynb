      "Dear Sir or Madam! Slovenia is currently already in a situation of being a transit country, as far as transport infrastructure is concerned. The motorways are heavily congested, and there is a huge amount of renovation work, mainly during a period when the roads are also characterised by congestion caused by foreign citizens. Freight traffic is an additional, and extremely heavy, burden. There is a huge amount of traffic, too much for Slovenian motorways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partial overtaking bans for freight vehicles can be observed on certain sections, but often only with a time limit. I propose to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure that it should generally ban overtaking by all goods vehicles and vehicles which, by their very nature, have a maximum speed limit for the carriage of goods. This would apply for 24 hours on all sections of motorways. Breaking it would result in heavy penalties for both the driver and the haulier.I suggest for all those employers and workers who work on a part-time basis and there is no possibility of part-time or full-time employment or starting a new job.A 0 hours per week contract,which should be the case,the employer is not obliged to work a certain amount of hours,the worker works when he needs it,so it can be 0-or 40 hours per week depending on the need,overtime does not exist because the worker is paid for all the hours he works,.The wage should be paid every 100 hours -one day,no recourse,no transport reimbursement,snacks can be included or not,all contributions are paid...for pension,health insurance,if the worker is sick,sick pay is not paid...for pension,health insurance,if the worker is sick,sick pay is not paidThere should be security so that the person who has left work and is at home takes care of the parent or parent who provides full care in the home environment, which means that he or she takes care of the child personally, helping him or her with all the basic needs of life, feeding, drinking, dressing and undressing, washing, getting up, moving around, turning around, using the toilet, and keeping him or her safe, further provides her with health care by cooperating with her personal doctor, organising access to the necessary health services, taking prescribed therapy and helping her to take medication, carrying out certain physiotherapy procedures, caring for wounds, preventing and caring for pressure sores, obtaining prescription medicines and assistive devices with a referral (wheelchair, anti bedsore cushion, dressings, nappies, etc.), assists with mobility, assists with the use and cleaning of aids and further provides social care by helping to establish and maintain social and, above all, kinship ties, handles all mail and personal administration, informs the doctor and the matron of the condition and needs, furthermore, provides all the domestic assistance she needs, such as preparing suitable food and drinks for her, as healthily and naturally as possible, maintaining the premises and ensuring that they are adequately heated, making and changing the bed, keeping the premises clean and washing the laundry and clothes, arranging the living environment according to the needs of the parent with disabilities, and so on,If you have a GP and a dentist, and women have a gynaecologist from the public health system, then you pay compulsory health insurance, otherwise you don't. Let's get this sorted out.Why find hot water with a property tax when we already have a building land use allowance. Let it stay as it is, just to change the name is expensive, there are procedures and a lot of administrative procedures and, in the end, court procedures. The result is only congestion in the administration and the courts and an unnecessary burden on the Constitutional Court. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia should take the property tax project off the agenda.I propose to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia to draw up a regulation and to order the Health Insurance Institute and insurance companies covering supplementary insurance to inform the insured person 1 x a year how much he/she has paid for the insurance and how much has been paid for him/her due to an insurance event when he/she visited a doctor and a pharmacy. I believe that the information system allows this and there would be no cost for this, it can be arranged with the cooperation of the FURS and the Health Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Health.Any proposals to increase the RTV contribution should be rejected. The current situation should be remedied by abolishing the compulsory payment of the RTV contribution. With modern technology, it is extremely easy to exclude programmes from the programming scheme. I therefore propose to the Government to abolish the compulsory payment of the RTV contribution and to introduce appropriate technical solutions regarding the restriction of the display of RTV channels.Since most dog owners are completely indifferent when it comes to cleaning up after their dogs, I propose to the government that an environmental tax be introduced for all dog owners, which is then collected by the municipality to clean up the environment (lawns, parks, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I have the feeling that there are more dogs in Slovenia than citizens.I propose that ways be found to encourage companies to allow their employees to work at home, where possible and to the extent that the job allows. Similarly, employees of the public administration should also be given the opportunity to work from home in jobs that allow it and to the extent that the job allows.\n",

      " \n",
      "In addition, homeworking would reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions from transport.I suggest the government introduce a tax on dogs and give the money to pensioners....Every day, people drive around Slovenia in (high-end) vehicles (Porsche, Ferrari, BMW, MB, Audi, etc.) with Slovak licence plates. These persons have a registered company in Slovakia and live in Slovenia 365 days a year. They pay no tax here, no registration fee and no other duties. They use our infrastructure, health, education and other services on a daily basis (free of charge).\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest that the government pass an appropriate law to make such things impossible, and I also urge the government to consider some kind of reduction in the levy on the purchase of such vehicles to avoid such anomalies.I propose to restrict the traffic of goods vehicles during peak hours (e.g. 6:00 - 9:00 and 15:00 - 17:00) on motorways and expressways in the Republic of Slovenia. During these times, goods vehicles should occupy the lane of traffic, while cars should be allowed to drive only in the overtaking lane. This causes congestion (the Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â tajerska AC) of several kilometres, which makes it difficult for all of us commuters to get to work and home every day. The lorries that use our roads at this time are overwhelmingly transit traffic, so the measure would not have a major impact on our hauliers and economy.To improve road safety, we propose that the government adopt a measure banning the use of any vacuum holders on the windscreen of vehicles, as devices such as navigation, mobile phones, smartphones, etc. obstruct the driver's field of vision and, due to their position on the windscreen, automatically divert the driver's attention to them. In the event of an accident, it has also been shown that the device is highly likely to hit the driver or passengers in the head and cause injury.\n",
      " This measure has already been adopted in some other countries (Switzerland, some states in the USA) to improve the safety of the vehicle occupants in the event of an accident, as well as to improve the driver's concentration, where the use of other mounts mounted securely in more suitable positions in the vehicle has been recommended, e.g. in the case of the head restraint.  where there is no risk of the device flying out of the windscreen into the upper body or head area and, above all, where the driver's attention is not distracted during the driving itself, as the devices so placed are not directly in the driver's field of vision.\n",
      "In my opinion, given the less than ideal state of Slovenian roads, the proposal deserves a great deal of attention and serious consideration. As an example, I would cite the use of a small TETRAX magnetic holder, which can be easily placed in the air vent slot or glued to the dashboard, so that the mobile phone or navigation device is closer and within reach, and does not get in the way when driving. More info at www.tetrax.si.\n",
      "  We have an increasing number of social assistance recipients and unemployed persons, including the so-called exploitation of these cash transtverts. On the other hand, there is an increasing shortage of home care workers in old people's homes, including nurses !\n",
      "\n",
      " We have people at the employment service who are paid for not working -- these people must be engaged in socially useful work for as many and as many hours of compulsory work for the amount of money they get !!! ( No excuse for not being able to make a bed or help wash an elderly person, help feed an elderly person, take someone for a walk. ) With this we can relieve the burden on the nursing staff ! There are also many changes that could be made elsewhere for the better In some homes for the elderly the situation is getting worse. I propose unannounced inspections of care homes, with the findings made publicly available to all users and relatives, to monitor improvements or the implementation of remedial measures.  As a country we could take a range of measures to reduce unemployment in other sectors too, there are many suggestions including cleaning up Slovenia where our country is absolutely thriving from the dirt by the roads and so on ! at the same time also punishing work shirking if you refuse to work you lose all rights !    IN THIS WAY THE AUCTION CAN ALSO SHOW THAT IT CARES ABOUT THE ELDERLY -- WE ALL KNOW THAT NOT ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO LIVE IN A HOME !  THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT PAY THE EXTRA FEES FOR THE ELDERLY WOULD ALSO BE RELIEVED IF IT WAS SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL TO MAKE SUCH WORK COMPULSORY ! Many elderly people want to live in their own homes even though they are helpless - they need a lift to the doctor , to the shops or help with cleaning occasionally at least I hope that these elderly people were working taxpayers who are forgotten by everyone in their old age lpSlovenia's development strategy, like many sectoral strategies, emphasises \"SUSTAINABILITY\" as a desired goal. Sustainable mobility is also included in this framework. The implementation of this sustainable mobility is reflected in the construction of roads (hot topics are: Ljubljana bypass, third development axis, etc.) - which is not very sustainable. And on the other hand, various investments in public transport - which is a real step.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the course of my studies and thinking about my future work and very likely commuting to bigger cities (standing in crowds, wasting time driving, etc.) I came up with an idea:\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is that the reason for the congestion of the roads in the bigger cities (Ljubljana) at peak times is the distribution of the workplaces. Workers (usually each in their own car) drive to them every day. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THE NUMBER OF JOURNEYS REQUIRED CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "HOW WOULD THIS BE POSSIBLE?\n",
      "\n",
      "- By encouraging work from home or in \"co-working\" spaces, which are found in many smaller regional and local centres today.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Maybe, because in many workplaces all you need is a computer and the internet... More of that in the future...\n",
      "\n",
      "- SLOVENIA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR IT: the number of registered tele-workers is very low...\n",
      "\n",
      "I realise that this decision is largely up to employers. Nevertheless, the State can take measures to encourage this. I have also read some studies in which the majority of employers who have decided to promote this see many advantages and do not regret their decision. Japan has even identified the promotion of working from home as a measure to reduce traffic problems. Studies also cite other positive aspects of working from home in terms of people's satisfaction (self-organisation of time, more time for family and leisure activities, etc.), and of course the environment (we are not sufficiently aware of the fact that more than 50% of greenhouse gases come from our vehicles), among other things, it could help to keep the countryside vital (it's not the only solution for young people with an education to move to Ljubljana, etc.)....\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not about people doing all their work from home. But just if the civil servants who work in the various civil service jobs (all of which are concentrated in Ljubljana) did their work from home two days a week... 100 fewer cars at a specific time on those days could make a big difference. There would be no need for a new bypass...\n",
      "\n",
      "So I propose this as an addition to the promotion of JPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "And don't get me wrong: I am also aware of the drawbacks of this kind of work... This matter should be approached thoughtfully.\n",

      " Following the example of the Scandinavian countries, where until recently it paid not to impose taxes, instead of raising the tax on rents to 30%, Slovenia would reduce the tax to 15% and as a result collect a higher amount of taxes. At 30% we can expect less tax revenue. I would even venture to say that if the tax were reduced to 10%, the tax revenue would be the highest.I propose that a part-time 30 hours a week, with a guaranteed minimum wage, be introduced as soon as possible to make it a full-time job. Anyone who wants a higher wage will be able to work the normal 40 hours, but no longer. The purpose of the measure is to employ additional people and to relieve those who have the lowest and most difficult jobs.  Those who want to earn more will also be more motivated to work more, because they will be able to choose between working 30 hours a month for the same wage, i.e. the minimum wage, as now, or working overtime and thus receiving a higher wage, because it is right that hard-working and industrious people should be rewarded, and that the place should be equalised in some way. Other jobs can also be reduced proportionately, in terms of the deviation from the average job, from 0-30%. The consequence of the measure will be that many people with higher salaries will decide to work only 30 hours, albeit for a lower salary, and the efficiency of the work will in most cases be unchanged, because we know that in certain jobs only 60% of the work is done efficiently, so we are overpaying people for 40% of the work they do not do, while the workers are being exploited to almost 100% and more, because they are also working overtime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. That is why we need to introduce a new norm so that the 30-hour working day is somehow a 100% measure of efficiency, the rest is overtime. And the fact is that more heads know more and more people do more work than one person, so we need to hire more people for shorter hours and give them the opportunity to prove themselves.When calculating the property tax, the carbon footprint of heated buildings should also be taken into account. Buildings with good insulation and a heat pump should pay less tax than those without insulation and heated with oil. An energy performance certificate, which is compulsory for most properties anyway, can help.I propose to abolish the tax on expensive sports cars, for the sake of economic growth. This tax has been in force in Slovenia since 2012 and is calculated according to the engine capacity. Registering an expensive sports car in Slovenia is more expensive than in some other countries, so many Slovenian owners prefer to register their cars abroad, thus losing Slovenia a lot of tax or money. Many owners register them in Slovakia and Germany.For some forms of s.p. (after-hours crafts), there is an additional pension contribution of approx. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬35 per month, which is not counted towards the pension.\n",
      "\n",
      "I propose that this be changed, as in fact it is paid twice and only one premium (from regular employment) is taken into account in the payment of the pension.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contribution to the supplementary health insurance makes some sense, because anyone who works more is more likely to be injured at work. Whereas working extra will not entitle him to a higher pension, even if he has paid more into the fund.\n",

I would also suggest that, because of the very specific nature of these vehicles (cycling on cycle lanes, on the right-hand shoulder, etc.), which is very different from other vehicles, the category for this type of vehicle should not be obtained automatically from any other category, but that the theoretical part of the test should be taken in any case.

It is not possible to own a lot of non-residential property anywhere abroad without paying tax on it. In most cases it is 1% of the value of the property. If we were to introduce such a tax here, a lot of people would probably decide to put their properties on the market, and house prices would fall...

After the changes of 1 August 2019, the number of heavy goods vehicles on the road has increased sharply again, virtually overnight, and I do not notice any difference in the number, if I compare the situation today with the situation before 1 June 2019.

They are therefore not car parks. They avoid crossing the border, they destroy the infrastructure and meadows in Slovenia, they leave rubbish behind them - and we do not benefit (at least they pay a parking fee in the car parks set up for them). This is what is happening at the moment, when they have an added exception to cross the Dobovec border crossing, and this is also what happened between June and August, when they were not even allowed to cross that crossing, and they left their vehicles virtually in front of the border.

My proposal is to limit these subsidies to smaller and cheaper vehicles worth up to a maximum of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬30 000 excluding VAT.

      "If the state is serious about electric cars being the future, then I also suggest that it gradually replace its civilian fleet at all levels (government, agencies, local authorities, public institutions, justice, education, etc.) with electric cars. In this way, it will see first-hand all the advantages and disadvantages of such cars, and it may also inspire some of its employees to adopt an electric car for private use.I propose that the state pays for additional health insurance for all pensioners who receive a pension below the minimum wage. There may of course be exceptions to this, e.g. people who have never worked, people who have paid only for a narrower range of benefits, etc.Changes in the economic environment make it pointless to levy crisis taxes. The current system leads to many high-end vehicles being registered abroad and consequently avoiding any tax. I propose the following changes to charging:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. abolish DMV altogether, only VAT is paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Individuals can no longer import a car, only companies can do so. This means that VAT would always be payable in Slovenia also on all imported second-hand cars on which no VAT is currently payable in Slovenia. Proof of VAT payment is a prerequisite for registering a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. a ban on the import of vehicles with emissions exceeding Euro 5 or even Euro 6. Very important from an ecological point of view. The average value of the vehicles is also raised and more VAT is charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. ending subsidies on electric vehicles, we will do more for the environment with the restrictions in point 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, this regulation would bring more taxes into the coffers than the current payment of the DMV, because by collecting VAT on even imported second-hand vehicles, we would end up collecting more. Especially if we take into account the \"repatriation\" of all the higher-end vehicles that Slovenians currently drive on foreign plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reflection - Introduce the possibility to deduct VAT if the car is bought by a company and is not used for private purposes. If FURS finds that the car was used for private purposes and the company has charged VAT, it will have to pay it again at the same value. This would further increase car sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional requirement for registration of new vehicles:\n",
      "\n",
      "All new cars must be fitted with emergency and pedestrian braking systems. The best system to reduce accidents.I propose that the Labour Inspectorate has 100% of all the powers and that it is not necessary for the worker to go to court to recover his rights (recourse, unpaid work, illegal employment relationship, which includes 40 hours/week student work, etc.) after the visit of the Labour Inspectorate. Instead, the inspection should write a report that is valid.\n",
      "In the event of an illegal employment relationship, the labour inspectorate should immediately have the power to order the employer to pay whatever is due to the worker (regress, holidays, snacks, commuting, wage differential from other employees for the same work) or to remedy other irregularities in the workplace.\n",
      "In this way, many more violations would be corrected, because it would be easier.\n",
      "This would be better both for the State and for the general social security of workers, who are always the weaker link in the employment relationship, as already defined in the Employment Relations Act. This would help and encourage workers to report to the inspectorate, which would then take swift action to ensure that workers' rights are respected. Workers who are victimised would thus avoid being in trouble, lengthy court proceedings and the loss of nerves caused by the length of these proceedings, which is pointless if there is already very strong evidence that can be found by the inspectorate when it visits.\n",
      "I would like to ask for this proposal to be considered, as there are many violations of basic rights at work in Slovenia and this would significantly improve the social situation of workers.since the government is planning to abolish supplementary insurance, why not introduce an additional paid quota? Suppose the price of the insurance covers the basic services (check-up, treatment, hospital, etc.) and the rest (implants, spas, medicines and similar services that are extra) add a payable quota for those who opt for it. This way, you cover the shortfall that will arise and the money can be kept back. You cannot satisfy 400 000 people because it is not right for them. you have to make sure that you cover the money. you give everyone the option of insurance and also allow them to choose whether they want only the basic or the supplementary. you allow children up to the age of 18 to have everything.I propose that all other vehicles on the motorway should also be subject to electronic mileage-based tolling. Where today it is possible to buy a vignette, it should be converted into the sale and refund of darsGo devices....... A DarsGo device can be redeemed for \"perpetual\" or for a limited period of time. A deposit is paid for this time, which is refunded on return......... Such a system is in place in Slovakia for trucks....\n",
      "\n",
      "This system of charging by kilometres is the most cost-effective, as the vignette system benefits the most those who drive the most, and these are mostly the slowest. Those who drive a few times a year, however, are overpaying for the vignette...\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, transit tourists often choose local roads because it is not worth buying a vignette for short distances of up to 100km..... these distances, they would buy a DarsGo device because they would have less cost in tolls than they would in driving longer on ordinary roads...\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, this would mean that, for example, a tourist would buy a DarsGo device for his category of vehicle on Sentil and pay a credit and a refund deposit within 30 days. When returning home, he would return the darsGo device to Sentil and be refunded the remaining balance and deposit..... If the device is not returned within 30 days, the deposit would be automatically collected, which is at least 5x the value of the darsGo device......\n",

This could also be done by increasing the toll for lorries by e.g. 2x during these times. This would alleviate daily traffic congestion.I propose to introduce a 10% tolerance of impunity for speeding. It does not matter if the speed limit is 30, 50, 70, 110 or 130 km/h.

The allocation of full-time working time shall take into account the needs of the working process and shall protect the rights of civil servants to breaks and rest periods. Unless the full-time working time is specifically scheduled by the Head of Unit or by another person under his authority, full-time working time shall be deemed to be scheduled by fixing the start of working time between 07.00 and 09.00 and the end of working time between 15.00 and 17.30 or on Fridays between 14.30 and 16.30. The obligatory working hours of a civil servant shall be from 09.00 to 15.00 and until 14.30 on Fridays. Civil servants working in the administrative units and regional units of the authorities shall have irregular full-time working hours, with a floating start between 7.00 and 8.00 and a floating end between 15.00 and 16.30 on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, between 18.00 and 18.30 on Wednesday, between 13.00 and 14.30 on Friday and between 12.00 and 12.30 on Saturday.

      "I believe that the average citizen visits and needs the services of the administrative unit or the social work centre more often than the court. Given that these state bodies operate normally with their own timetables, I see no reason why the courts should not do the same. Longer opening hours on Wednesdays would also make it easier for clients to deal with court matters.\n",
      "This would make it easier for court staff to balance their private and professional lives, which is difficult with the current timetable. The winter months in particular (school, kindergarten, shorter days, etc.) have a worse impact on the psychological state of the individual, as he or she finishes work when it is already dark and is practically at work all day. Many staff members are also commuters and need extra time to get to and from work. There is no doubt that a different court timetable would have a major impact on the quality of life of the staff member, better working efficiency and a positive working climate. Mandatory presence of a civil servant at work from 09.00 to 15.00 and until 13.00 on Fridays would also allow for the smooth running of office hours. This change in working hours is made in order to promote a work-life balance for staff, as there is a lot of talk these days about flexibility, which is not felt by the staff of the courts.Dear Sir or Madam,\n",

      "\n",
      "At present, for public servants living in Maribor and working in Ljubljana, the train is accepted as an acceptable means of transport for commuting, with a journey time of approximately 180 minutes for locations more than one station away from the main railway station; not to mention delays. So 8 hours of work + 6 hours of travel and that leaves 10 hours for family life, the latter including sleep. And the lack of time for family, sport and rest itself brings with it many other things. So the actual rest between the time such a civil servant has to travel and the time he gets home is at most 10 hours. Thus, there is a need for a change in the interpretation or the provision of Article 155 of the ZDR-1 itself, because there is no rest when you are just on your way home.\n",

Land value tax would also be an additional burden on the socially disadvantaged, and a minimum cost would be calculated each year.

      "The Republic of Slovenia currently has more than 6 000 000 properties and a population of just over 2 000 000 inhabitants, the number of which has not increased significantly in recent years, yet property prices are constantly rising, far outstripping inflation. It is therefore clear that the housing crisis will not be solved by building new housing, as there is already more than enough of it. A new financing structure would therefore allow for more favourable house prices for first home buyers, with more emphasis on land and property values. It would promote efficient use of land and development in less developed parts of the Republic of Slovenia and raise funds in a fairer way.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sudden implementation of the proposal would mean a major change from the point of view of both municipalities and citizens, I propose that the change be introduced gradually, with an appropriate transition period of 4 years.I suggest that the Government considers the following proposal. There are quite a lot of people in the RS who receive social support of one kind or another. When processing an application, the competent authority obtains practically all the information about the individual, the family in terms of financial situation and income. The next step could be to adopt legislation to the effect that if an individual violates positive legislation (commits or has committed a crime or misdemeanour), his or her social assistance would be reduced in proportion to the violation. Quite simply. Thus, individuals would be forced to comply with the law if they wanted to receive social assistance. If they were unable to look after their children because they had no income (they were too diligent in committing crimes - misdemeanours), the social services would take care of them. Such irresponsible parents really cannot bring up their children, because they will be even more prone to breaking the law and harming people who, by working hard, contribute money to the budget.\n",
      "I realise that the proposal is very sloppily written, but what it would achieve is that individuals would not deliberately break the law because they would fear for their cash income from social transfers. The fact is that we all pay for social transfers, we are all employed, we pay taxes, etc. It is completely incomprehensible that an individual who receives money from social transfers is doing harm (offences, crimes) against the society that contributes money to him. What we are witnessing today is an individual who receives more than the minimum wage in social transfers and who commits various crimes or offences to increase this amount significantly. Let social assistance really be for those who need it, and not for those who enrich it by causing harm to the rest of the working population of the Republic of Slovenia.I propose that the public be legally allowed to consult the Register of Motor Third Party Liability Insurance and Motor Third Party Insurance claims, with limited data (protection of personal data), of course.\n",
      "Around 200 000 second-hand cars are sold every year.\n",
      "Buyers can already check the vehicle's history (roadworthiness tests, mileage, age, location and sex of owner, etc.) using the VIN number. This information is publicly available, and is displayed in a user-friendly way, e.g. on the avtolog.si website.\n",
      "What is missing is information on any road accidents the vehicle has been involved in. Vehicles can therefore be sold as undamaged, but the buyer cannot verify this information. This leads to misleading and detrimental effects on buyers, as well as hidden defects and the associated risk of further accidents.\n",
      "The Slovenian Insurance Association already maintains a register of claims under the law, but access to the data is only available to victims of a car accident.\n",
      "The Act on Compulsory Motor Insurance does not provide a legal basis for making the data from the claims register open and accessible to the public.\n",
      "I propose that the public be given limited access to the Register of Damages by law, either through an online service or through a database.\n",
      "The data should include at least the VIN number of the vehicle, and the date of the accident. The amount of the claims would also be welcome, as would any information that further clarifies the nature and extent of the damage to the vehicle. Personal data (insurance policy holder, etc.) should remain inaccessible to the public.The real estate law, which is partly labelled as unconstitutional, still has a couple of articles that have a big impact on homeowners who rent out their flats while renting elsewhere.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, he receives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬300 a month for renting it, but rents it in another city for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬400. Already here he is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬100 in the red (which is due to the different prices).\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in addition to the tax on renting out the property, the landlord also pays property tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is quite unfair, because he is not actually making a profit on the property (which he would if he had 2 or more flats) but sometimes a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the law that gives rise to this taxation be changed so that this property tax is levied when someone owns two or more flats and rents out at least one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if he owns one flat, it should be taken into account that he has to live somewhere and that he rents somewhere else.\n",

      "The law should also be enforced nationwide or nowhere. At present, it is only implemented in certain municipalities.I propose an eco-tax for the first internal combustion passenger cars of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬200 per year.

      "The idea is to rapidly reduce the number of internal combustion vehicles, reduce the number of vehicles owned by people, and use other means of transport for short distances.

      " For several years now, since the last financial crisis, traffic on Slovenian roads (especially on the roads leading into Ljubljana and on the ring road) has been increasing by several % every year. It is well known that public transport in Slovenia is not keeping pace with the increase in transport demand, and it is therefore urgent that, while continuing to develop public transport, active work on congestion management should be undertaken as a stepping stone, as reducing congestion would make a significant contribution to the economic and social well-being of the citizens. In large European cities, congestion management is addressed through pricing policies, i.e. whoever wants to travel at peak times pays more, hence the existence of several types of tickets. Visitors (especially tourists) to London have to pay significantly more for a public transport ticket to ensure that they can travel even during the rush hour (7:30-9:30 in the morning and 16:40-18:30 in the afternoon).\n",

      "\n",
      "2) Increasing the cost of non-urgent non-freight journeys, such as tourist transit. As we know, Slovenia is a very transit-oriented country. A vignette for the use of Slovenian roads would therefore exclude driving at peak times. Everyone would have to secure an additional \"pass\" to drive at peak times.\n",

      "3) The same measure as in point 2) could be introduced for all road users on the roads covered by the vignette in the current system.Hello,\n",
      "Pension policy does not take into account people who are in some way receiving social contributions in an undue way. Unmanaged in the sense that these people claim that they do not want to go to work in any way. Verified - I personally know of 2 cases where this is the case. It has also been reported in the media that a family of 3 has more social benefits than a family of 3 where at least one member works. So those who are working will have to work longer and longer to get their pensions with the new pensions policy, but at the same time we have more and more people who could work but don't want to, and manage to get social benefits. I personally know that such a person, for example, gets a newly renovated flat, for which he pays no rent, gets a social contribution, and lives modestly but comfortably, on a new sofa, in a warm flat (about 43 m3), with a new lcd screen, etc.\n",
      "Not all recipients of social contributions are in the same position, some are really managed to them. But how many of those who could work, are salaried, but under the cover of excuses do not work, and have no intention of ever working.\n",
      "At the same time, the number of employees in such state offices is not going to increase either, so there is no possibility of there being a team of people to check these things. There are no mechanisms, so it is all an end in itself, and that has long been a systemic flaw that perhaps no one wants to point out. Now is the time to bring pension policy into line with all the parameters, to make it as socially just as possible, as far as possible, for everyone.The trial valuation that is underway has anomalies, some properties do not even have an established value (no data), a set of identical properties of the same m2 e.g. garages in a set all different values and significant discrepancies, not to mention apartments, properties wrongly inventoried, even duplicated values, etc. I suggest to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia that it re-inventories the properties accurately, so that each property has a specific and correct indication of how many basements, garages and fire rooms, storerooms and staircases and corridors are in a given property and how many rooms and kitchens there are in reality.The ZDR-1 stipulates that an employer may not terminate the employment contract (serve notice of termination) of an employee during pregnancy, of an employee who is breastfeeding a child up to one year of age, and of parents during the period when they are taking parental leave (maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave) in the form of full absence from work in a consecutive series, and for one month after the leave has been taken. During this period and in these cases, the employer may not do anything that would otherwise be necessary to terminate the contract of employment or to recruit a new employee. However, the special protection against dismissal for parents and pregnant workers does not apply if there are grounds for extraordinary dismissal (with the prior agreement of the Labour Inspector) or for the opening of proceedings for the dissolution of the employer. The above protection for these categories of workers therefore also applies in the case of unsuccessful probationary work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ZDR-1 has introduced a number of changes in the area of probationary work. Under the previous regime, unsuccessful completion of probationary work was a ground for extraordinary termination of the employment contract, which, in conjunction with Article 115, meant that the employer could terminate the employment contract of a pregnant worker on the grounds of unsuccessful completion of probationary work, subject to the prior consent of the labour inspector. However, the failure to successfully complete the probationary period is now a ground for regular termination of the employment contract (new Article 89(1)(5)), with the employee being entitled to seven days' notice (Article 94(1)). In this respect, the wording of Article 115 has not changed as regards the protection of parents against dismissal or termination of the employment contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, the latter is completely \"unviable\" for the employer, since in such a case the employer cannot actually make use of the already agreed probationary work (even more problematic is the situation where such circumstances would have existed at the time of the conclusion of the contract, but the employee would have concealed them). The same opinion is also shared by the Head of the Legal, Human Resources and General Affairs Department of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who states in an expert article: \"There is no case law on the protection of pregnant workers and parents in the event of unsuccessful probationary work, but in my opinion, according to the purpose and logic of probationary work and the fact that the contract is concluded on a terminable basis, it would not be logical to protect these categories of workers from termination of their contracts for unsuccessful probationary work.\" It should be noted that the assessment of probationary work would be based on the actual performance of the employee and would not be based on the fact that she is pregnant or for any of the other reasons mentioned above. In the event that the probationary employee is negatively evaluated and one of the above categories applies, the employer would have no choice but to have an employee on the payroll who is not performing his/her job adequately or in accordance with the employer's expectations. The latter situation is absurd and leads to the abolition of the agreed probationary work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the purpose of probationary work and the encouragement of employers to conclude contracts of indefinite duration, I propose to the Government that regular dismissal for failure to complete probationary work be reinstated as an exception and included among the grounds where the special protection of protected categories against dismissal does not apply (i.e. Article 115(5) of the ZDR-1).In Ljubljana, a large number of parking machines are coin-operated only and do not accept coins of smaller denominations. The new machines will not accept smaller denominations either. I suggest that the government ensure that at least municipally owned machines accept legal tender - smaller denomination coins. As an alternative to this proposal, I have in the past sent a proposal that 1 and 2 cent coins should not be put into circulation and that the final amounts of cash payments should be rounded up to 5 cents, which has already been rejected by government representatives with the fallacious argument that this is not possible, even though it has already been done in FInland, Belgium, Ireland, partly in Italy and the Netherlands.I propose to abolish the cost of identifying a person when changing ownership of a vehicle, as this charge of around ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬6 per person is pure theft.\n",

Vehicle sales are now being curtailed, the state is collecting minimal taxes because most people make a rational purchase decision, while, on the other hand, vehicles worth EUR 100 000 and more are practically untaxed.

The average driver drives 15,000 km and, on a moderate consumption, the difference with the increase in fuel would be about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬100, which is the same as the average road user charge. The other classes should also be adjusted or redefined, as the current tariff is extremely high for some, irrespective of the kilometres travelled. Someone who pays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬400 or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬500 puts less strain on the roads than someone who pays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬100 and, for example, migrates to work every day.\n",

      "The luxury tax should also be reformed, because it has already been mentioned above that a car worth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬200 000 cannot be taxed at 1% and another car worth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬15 000 at 50% just because it has a more powerful engine. The threshold for luxury should be set at, for example, above ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬80 000 and then progressively increased. It is logical that luxury should be understood as the purchase of expensive things? At the moment, it is the other way round.\n",
      "\n",
      "A layman's calculation, based on SURS statistics, shows that if the petrol euro were to rise in price, the country would receive the same amount of tax as if it were to abolish the DMV and the luxury tax.

      "Pension policy does not take into account people who are in some way receiving social contributions in an undue way. Unmanaged in the sense that these people claim that they do not want to go to work in any way. Verified - I personally know of 2 cases where this is the case. It has also been reported in the media that a family of 3 has more social benefits than a family of 3 where at least one member works. So those who are working will have to work longer and longer to get their pensions with the new pensions policy, while at the same time we have more and more people who could work but don't want to, and manage to get social benefits. I personally know that such a person, for example, gets a newly renovated flat, for which he pays no rent, gets a social contribution, and lives modestly but comfortably, on a new sofa, in a warm flat (about 43 m3), with a new lcd screen, etc.\n",

If it is found that such a person could work and thus fill the state coffers, instead of receiving from the state indefinitely, that person should be actively involved in finding a job (statistics say that there is a shortage of certain profiles of professionals, but it is a pity that only such people receive the social contribution, instead of being in regular employment, because they are able to do so). The unemployment rate may rise, but the percentage of people on social benefits will fall, and so will the warning to others that you have to work to get a pension. However, if the state extends the time limit for pensions, it will also be at the expense of those who are not receiving social benefits properly but are able to work.\n",
      "I will hardly write a definitive systemic solution myself, but I have pointed to the guidelines for such a solution.After the unsuccessful negotiations with Fides on the introduction of austerity measures to reduce doctors' overtime pay, it became clear in the first days of September how urgently needed structural changes in the health network are, in particular, to ensure the conditions for the sustainability of the health budget. It is essential that hospital managements make a realistic assessment of the capacities at their disposal and the extent to which they can normally provide their services in relation to their own staffing levels. A restructuring programme should be drawn up in all health care institutions and a realistic timeframe should be set for the transition period in terms of staffing or the closure or merging of hospital departments. Health insurance should make it clear as soon as possible that it will not recognise disproportionate increases in hospital bed-times for services provided by hospitals.\n",
      " I suggest that people registered at the employment office be given the right to refuse a job for any reason, or that the conditions under which a job can be refused be specified precisely, and that all those registered and referred for interviews also be informed of this right, because I don't like the threats on every interview invitation, where it just says how you have to accept every job and show up for the interview, etc., etc., because otherwise, you may...\n",

Truck queues on the AC during peak hours (especially in the morning between 6-8am) are a daily occurrence, which further causes congestion, as the right lane is often fully occupied by trucks, leaving only one lane of the motorway for cars to drive. The vast majority of this freight traffic is transit traffic and does not carry perishable goods, so it would not make a significant difference for them to start their journey after 8am. Similarly, on these main roads leading out of Ljubljana, freight traffic could be restricted between 15.30 - 17.00.My suggestion is to pay from gross salary/pension... instead of supplementary health insurance, because it will be less noticeable to employees, and net pay correspondingly less.

      "The system could work something like this: you sign up for a specific type of work (e.g. in a retirement home), go through a short induction (this is where the state should step in and organise coordinated inductions in local communities), pay a nominal induction fee and get a \"volunteer badge\" which obliges you to do xy hours of volunteering per year. If you don't, you lose the badge and have to go through induction again. Perhaps one of the volunteers could then find a regular job in one of these institutions, get some experience, etc.\n",

I don't need the extra money, I love my job, but sometimes I miss the contact with people and the feeling that I have done something good for someone. Of course, we can always volunteer in this way, without systematisation, but I still think that such a system would be welcome, it would make it easier to find both the volunteers and the institutions that need such help, and by introducing it, we would somehow weed out people who might not be suitable for this kind of work.\n",
      " Motor Vehicle Tax (MVT) is payable on vehicles put into circulation or registered for the first time in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, for vehicles falling under certain tariff codes as defined in the European Community Customs Tariff. The VAT is payable on the taxable amount, which is the sales value of the motor vehicle, excluding value added tax (VAT) and this tax.\n",
      "The rate of the tax depends on a number of factors depending on the type and characteristics of the vehicle (type of vehicle, propulsion of the vehicle, CO2 emissions, EURO emissions, etc.) and is more precisely defined in the Law on the Tax on Motor Vehicles (Official Journal of the RS, No 72/06 - Official consolidated text, 9/10 and 40/12 - ZUJF).\n",

In fact, publicly available records show a huge decline in the number of newly registered vehicles of a higher price class (according to the criteria of the current law). We can also observe a number of bypasses that are taking place with the use of leasing and various rentals of foreign vehicles for private use of vehicles in road transport. If we compare the level of taxation with more developed neighbouring countries, we can see that we are much more heavily taxed than the Austrians or the Germans. The state is certainly not making any additional gains by pursuing a repressive policy of levying charges, especially not in the conjunctural times that we have experienced over the last few years.\n",
      "Just consider the following example. When we buy a car that has certain characteristics (volume, power, emission levels, etc.), we buy additional equipment, such as bigger wheels, leather seats or more powerful brakes. Due to the current legislation, we will pay up to 54% extra tax on the sale price for such an extra (up to 62% on diesel engines), if the above-mentioned characteristics are in the highest tariff bracket.\n",

      "In addition to the above solutions, I propose upgrading or building new passenger lines in the vicinity of Ljubljana to speeds of 160km/h and a correspondingly smaller number of stations (marked with larger circles in the annex). This would separate passenger rail traffic from freight traffic and allow for higher capacities for both the main freight lines (red in the annex) and the passenger lines (yellow), and in the area of concentrated population in Ljubljana, the Ljubljana Metro would run on the passenger line (smaller circles in the annex). The larger stations would be designed as park & drive, i.e. you could drive to the station, park and transfer to the train, and with increased speeds and direct lines, the train would be the fastest option and a tempting alternative.\n",
      "My personal opinion is that the proposed expansion of the AC sections near LJ to six lanes is a waste of money and will not solve traffic congestion, it will only divert more migration to the roads (for those who are interested in more, you can read what induced demand is and how it affects the roads), as traffic congestion on the roads is a reflection of poor rail infrastructure and lack of alternatives, not poor road infrastructure. Building two extra lanes of road increases capacity by around 2000 vehicles in one direction in one hour, by comparison a double-track railway can carry over 20000 passengers smoothly in one hour.\n",

The very base of training and preparation for foreign football clubs is a good example of good practice, including Planica, where a lot of foreign winter athletes train.... Lowering taxes would only increase interest.....Since wages are generally not rising in line with GDP growth (only exceptionally for managers), companies are exploiting the labour force in terms of the less active population, who have to work for three or more people, are in illegal employment, etc., and costs (housing, food, clothing) are rising, in line with income data from the Social Insurance Institution (ZPIZ), we should limit price rises and set a ceiling for the price of all costs. While the ZPIZ seemingly acts only as a data collector on wages and other benefits and expenses, I suggest that it should recruit experts who could evaluate the actual situation of the wage-cost ratio, which would ultimately result in reasonable prices for rents, property prices and household expenses. I believe that there is still too much variation in consumption in apartment blocks and that they do not show the real state of energy consumption in terms of saving on water consumption, etc. We should also limit property prices and rents in this way, because they do not promote a decent life for young people, the elderly or the old. So for the whole population, we can no longer say who is worse off, to be honest. We need to increase the control of non-compliance with the law, if it were implemented in terms of price caps, because if we were also to limit the disparity between wage ratios by law, we would not be tolerating poverty and we would not be tolerating precarious work. Why is it that a manager is so capable that he can literally have 10 times or more the wage of a worker, regardless of the type of education. What I observe is that the differences are huge, whatever the level of education and whatever the type of work. I propose that, also for managers, in the private sector, the salary of managers should be capped, as this could allow for greater employability, which is more necessary than managers having such high salaries. I believe that the current economy, which is in favour of competitiveness, does not see that, by not restricting capital, it is allowing capital to flow abroad. In addition, it is no wonder that illegal work is also being encouraged. I wonder whether we are really following the example of the northern European countries or whether we just want to do this and do nothing about it. What I can suggest to people is that we limit our purchases and do not go shopping every day if we can. We did not elect the shops to be open all the time, did we? I do not think we can sell everything, or we can.Aircraft are a major source of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.

Parking fines and automatic speed cameras have been taken over by traffic wardens, who measure in the easiest locations (where they expect the most fines), which are not necessarily the most dangerous. All the more serious offences (alcohol, speeding elsewhere, tailgating, wrong way, etc.) go unpunished because there is no policeman to see and punish.\n",
      "I propose that the money from fines for more serious offences (say those with a prescribed 5 penalty points or more) should be funnelled back into the police force as money for new recruits, and also for salary bonuses for the police officers who are most effective at such punishment.\n",
      "Limiting it to more serious offences is necessary, because otherwise (i.e. if all the money from all the fines were to flow back to the police) we would end up with a case of \"just to find something\". This would give us more staff, who would have a greater interest in catching the worst offenders (i.e. those who are the most dangerous in traffic).The e-tax website is an idea in the right direction. Unfortunately, the site is completely user-unfriendly. You have to click through a maze of words to find what you need to pay (contributions, income tax). If things were simplified so that even those of us who are more skilled in something other than bureaucracy could manage them without a problem, more money would flow into the public coffers. It is not logical that an entrepreneur should have to work so hard to pay something to the state. It would be more productive for the entrepreneur, and for the State, if the entrepreneur spent his time on his business, which he knows, earned as much as possible and paid his obligations in a straightforward manner.I notice that vehicles with halogen bulbs illuminate the road in front of the vehicle very poorly and even in the rain it is vedlivosk 0 (glare) compared to vehicles equipped with led or xenon lights. I know the problem with upgrading to blind vehicles going in the opposite direction (this is only true if the vehicle does not have a lens). So I propose to allow upgrading lights without any problem or need for any allowed, only for vehicles equipped with lenses (like the main light) so that the visibility is better and does not disturb other oncoming vehicles. Because even new vehicles have led lights without headlight washers or automatic beam height adjustment (renult e.g. clio, suzuki... (which I know they have)).\n",

Still not enough to make it worth registering abroad.\n",
      "Secondly, they have nicely taxed all the rest of the class, who now have the luxury of various Opels, Renaults, Golfs, Passats and other middle-class vehicles, for which they will now pay much more. If today it costs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬100 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬500, in 2021 it will cost between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬700 and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬3000.

This is for the simple reason that, if it is a minor abortion, the parents will have to know about it because they will pay for it, rather than the way it is now, where the parents do not necessarily have to be informed.I am reading an amendment to the DMV bill. Again, I wonder which \"expert\" has come up with such a complicated system of taxation. True, they abolished the luxury tax, which made no sense because it was linked not to price but to engine power, so that now a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬300,000 luxury car would cost ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬50,000 less.

      "At a time when the current political issue is the abolition of supplementary health insurance and the introduction of a compulsory contribution to health insurance with a solidarity scale according to income, we should consider whether the level of benefits is sufficient to determine the level of the compulsory contribution. The fact is that users of health services have very different lifestyles and habits and thus very different levels of risk of disease. A one-size-fits-all contribution, or a solidarity scale that takes into account only income, is discriminatory, since it treats drinkers and teetotallers, smokers and non-smokers, overweight and underweight people, walkers and those who enjoy risky adrenaline sports, etc., in the same way. The solidarity scale should therefore also introduce a kind of lifestyle risk index, determined by each person's personal or treating doctor, which would affect the amount of the individual's health insurance contribution. Thus, anyone whose risky lifestyle exposes them to diseases caused by alcohol, smoking, obesity, etc., would have to pay a correspondingly higher contribution. This is because such illnesses cost the Health Insurance Fund hundreds of millions a year, and at present all such costs are covered in solidarity by the same contribution, which means discriminatory treatment for all those with a risk-free lifestyle. If all those whose lifestyles put them at high risk of morbidity were charged an appropriately high contribution, this could probably induce many people to change their lifestyles, which would in turn bring non-negligible savings to the NHIF coffers and reduce the burden on the health service.\n",
      "Best regards,I propose that the Government, through the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Ministry of Health, implement a regulation requiring large public notices to be placed for people approaching the test area of electro-magnetic radiation suspected of being harmful to health. In Ljubljana, the MOL collects a fee for the placement of the notice, which is paid by the owner of the property on which the MOL has allowed the EM radiation sources to be placed. Human experimentation is prohibitedToday's house prices are, to put it simply, the result of too much demand and too little supply. I will outline my proposal below, but unfortunately it is not without a little background.\n",
      "Housing oversupply is an issue that has been going on for decades (the attachment shows the number of new homes built by time period), but it has really come to the fore in the last few years. All the developable land in the major centres has already been subdivided and built on, and the owners have no interest in selling. As a result, it is rare for investors to get their hands on cheap land in city centres and then not be able to exploit the land to its full potential due to strict building laws and restrictions on new developments by the local population.\n",
      "We Slovenians ourselves are to blame for the over-increase, because we want to invest every euro we have in real estate. The result is that today more than 300 000 Slovenians own more than four properties, and even more own three or two. As a result, even the few newly built homes are being bought up by those who already own property and are paying off their loans by renting them out. And so a vicious circle is created, where house prices are constantly rising and young people are finding it harder and harder to get a home of their own.\n",
      "My proposed solution:\n",
      "- Taxing all residential property except the first one with a 2% property tax would make buying a second property a bad investment and Slovenians would invest their money elsewhere.\n",
      "- A much higher compensation for the use of building land would force owners of poorly used land in cities to sell their land to investors.\n",
      "- Cities that are the centres of cohesion regions would become special zones, the size of which would be proportional to the population of the region, and building legislation would be relaxed in these zones.\n",
      "- The new revenue from property tax and building land allowance could be used to abolish income and corporate taxes, which would raise the standard of living for Slovenians.\n",
      "Low property prices should be in the interest of all Slovenians. The advantages of agglomeration are lower energy consumption and environmentally friendly policies, higher economic growth at the expense of less money spent on maintenance of local infrastructure, fewer young people going abroad in search of better opportunities, higher birth rate of first property owners, better health of people (less anxiety, depression, asthma, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, etc.), etc...Just over 100 people a year die from bad air. Problems are manifesting themselves in several cities around the world (BIH, Serbia, Italy, China, India, etc.) and in Germany, they have started to restrict the use of disels. This is not possible here, because the central vehicle register does not contain this information (whether it is diesel or petrol), and I suggest that this be properly regulated and that work be started once and for all to ensure that we live in a clean environment, and that we do not live in a city where 130000 cars are driven into the city every day, polluting, and the citizens of Ljubljana are on foot and on bicycles.\n",

      "the second point is however the powers and responsibility of the TP service, namely upon acceptance of the vehicle for TP management the status of the no no. is checked and entered in the system which checks and displays the entire history of the entries and in case of deviation (lower no.) the vehicle is automatically detained until the postponement of the evidence (maybe engine change) and of course the responsible service is immediately informed (police) which then also makes a proposal for a crime/fraud and is punished accordingly and in the case of the seller (company, shop, s.In this way, and only in this way, can we protect and ensure a fairly safe and reliable information for each customer and reduce the possibility of fraud.\n",

In this way, they mislead or cheat the consumer, most often those who are least well-off. Since this is dirt, sleaze and deception of consumers, of the people, high fines should also be introduced as a percentage of gross turnover, and criminal liability should be imposed on all those involved, not just on the director.I propose that a new regulation or an amendment to the existing one be made for the carrying out of vehicle roadworthiness tests, linked to the actual kilometres travelled, separately for cars and lorries.\n",
      "I propose the following system:\n",
      "Passenger cars: no MOT required up to 100,000 km, then every 40,000 km thereafter up to 300,000 km and every 20,000 km thereafter over 300,000 km.\n",
      "Light goods vehicles up to 3.5T: no TP required up to 100,000km, then every 40,000km for every 80,000km thereafter up to 340,000km for every 40,000km thereafter.\n",
      "Heavy goods vehicles over 3.5T: TP every 100,000km up to a total of 500,000km and every 50,000km thereafter\n",
      "A system should be introduced to record the total kilometres driven at the time of the TP for each vehicle separately, linked to the vehicle's body number, with the possibility to consult it at the time of sale - purchase of a second-hand vehicle.\n",
      "This would prevent owners from resetting the actual mileage of the vehicle at the time of sale and, in my opinion, unnecessary technical inspections of vehicles that do not cover nearly the number of km in a year that would require them to have a MOT according to the above norms.\n",
      "Of course, the system of actual kilometres driven and, consequently, the TP is also adjusted accordingly.Many of you have been in a collision with a vehicle or have a vehicle whose lights are very dim and you can see practically nothing in front of you. You have tried the much-vaunted LED daytime running lights, which are great, but the problem is that they are not legal, so you have no choice but halogen daytime running lights (original), which give off a very poor light. With bad headlights you endanger your safety and the safety of other road users who may be overlooked because of the poor illumination. I therefore propose that the Government introduce a special technical inspection where you could fit LED or HID headlights to your vehicle, which would then be checked by apparatus to see if they are sufficient and correct and do not dazzle passing motorists, which you would pay for, and if the headlights were suitable and safe for use on the road, you would be given a special card authorising the use of these headlights in your vehicle in traffic.In addition to the existing fines for speeding drivers, I propose to introduce a system of recording speeding and, consequently, entering the reduced - limited - speed limit for the driver as a percentage of the generally applicable speed limit on the driver's licence. The limit should be marked on the vehicle with a penalty sticker for the duration of the penalty.\n",
      "e.g.: Anyone who commits the offence of speeding more than 10Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°% of the speed limit should, in addition to the fine, be given a record of his speed limit being -10% lower than the current speed limit, which would mean that he has to drive everywhere 10% slower than everyone else because he would otherwise be in contravention. His vehicle would also have to have penalty stickers visible to all road users.It proposes to sanction serious offences, including by confiscating the vehicle.\n",
      "These would be offences such as: driving in the opposite direction on the motorway, exceeding the speed limit by 100% or more, unregistered vehicles, driving in a quantity for which the current law already provides for the withdrawal of the driving licence. Possibility of public auction of the vehicle, after one year from the date of withdrawal.\n",
      "The reason, simple. Look at how traffic has calmed down where the cops are lying. Because, for many people, a car means more than a fine, because they have too much money or too little.\n",
      "That is why I think it would be a good idea to pass a law that would hit offenders on the car, because that has been proven to work. Lying cops.\n",

      "I would like to draw your attention to the following. As full-time employees with a supplementary activity (after-hours s.p.), we already pay basic health insurance on our salaries and, as individuals, supplementary health insurance separately. As an after-hours sole trader (for activities outside work), we pay monthly benefits to ZPIZ (EUR 33,90) and ZZZS (EUR 35,53), which provide us with little or nothing. They do not count towards our working time, nor do they provide us with any additional or complementary health services (as we are already insured for the latter as part of our regular job), which means that we are paying for something that we have nothing to gain from. I believe that there are quite a few afternoon S.P.'s and that all of us who faithfully pay the pointless charges could at least be exempted from paying for supplementary health insurance. Someone who is in full-time employment pays compulsory health insurance with his gross salary, but pays supplementary health insurance separately. Someone who is a classic sole trader pays the compulsory health insurance as part of the sole trader's contributions, and the supplementary health insurance separately. A part-time s.p., on the other hand, pays compulsory health insurance already with his regular gross salary at work, plus supplementary insurance as an individual and \"health insurance\" as a part-time s.p., but despite the double payment, is treated no differently from the first two categories.\n",

      "They are doing harm not to themselves, but to the worker, who does not receive a higher wage than he could have received if the company had not given him a minimum wage supplement.\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "A worker has a contract stating that he has a basic salary of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬810 GROSS. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬810 gross he still gets a minimum wage supplement of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬130.58.\n",

      "-2% length of service allowance-16,20ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ gross\n",

      "-5% seniority allowance-47,5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ gross\n",
      "Then where are all the other allowances due to the worker, all of which are calculated at ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬810 gross. This is just an example\n",
      "There are even higher allowances up to the minimum wage\n",
      "It must therefore be legislated immediately that employers are no longer allowed to pay a worker a supplement to the minimum wage, but must pay the worker the minimum wage set by law.\n",

And the companies will boast about the profits they have made.The current system is that workers must have a medical check-up before starting work. This is great for the worker, but it brings a few complications - no \"today-tomorrow\" employment, not worthwhile for very short-term employment, students have to be managed as a separate group with exceptions, etc.\n",
      "I propose to draw up a list of the jobs that most workers do (standing, sitting, computer work, lifting objects up to 25 kg, etc.) and to have an examination to certify the worker's ability to do all these basic requirements - but this certificate would be valid for three years as before, regardless of the employer (so if you change from one office job to another and you have had an examination a year ago, you do not need a new examination for two years). For occupations with specific requirements (psychological examinations, etc.), an additional examination would be carried out according to the additional requirements of the specific job.\n",
      "For students, such an examination would be carried out as part of the regular systematic examinations already carried out during their studies.\n",
      "This would simplify recruitment for all and reduce unnecessary checks. This would also be the first precondition for putting student work on an equal footing with other forms of work, as this rule would also apply to them in the same way as to others.Road users are required to use vignettes which are divided into toll classes (Class 1, 2A, 2B). Which vehicles belong to which toll classes is often unclear and is left to the interpretation of the regulations, which are unclear or interpreted by DARS employees in their own way, which results in the user not knowing which vignette is appropriate. In view of the problem, this has been partially solved by the list of measured vehicles for classes 2A and 2B and these users are also entitled to reimbursement in case of using the wrong vignette. The problem occurs between Class 1 and 2A, in which case users are not entitled to reimbursement even though the user consults the DARS call centre before purchase and is advised to purchase what turns out to be an inappropriate vignette due to unclear regulations. I suggest that DARS should also list on its website and in a prominent place the measured vehicles for single-track motor vehicles and allow these users to be reimbursed also in case it is unclear which vignette is appropriate for their vehicle. At the same time, this list would be of great help to DARS staff in advising road users.I would also suggest that the government consider addressing the credit issues of the population in these times... the income of the population will be considerably reduced, so I would suggest a solution in the sense of a moratorium on credit repayments for the duration of the epidemic (perhaps extending the period of credit repayments for the duration of the declared crisis - as many months as the instalments are not paid, the credit repayments would be extended by that amount, but in any case not that the time of credit repayments would not be reduced, assuming a moratorium and a consequent increase in the instalment of the credit). Of course, writing off monthly instalments for the time of a declared crisis would not be accepted even in a dream, but given that the banks have in the past received a huge amount of help from the State (the population!!!), perhaps in this situation the banks could also help the population, because in the final analysis, any credit (in terms of interest) will be repaid in full and no more!!!My suggestion is that banks should put a moratorium on credit repayments for a period of, say, 3 months after the end of the epidemic, which would be a very big help to the economy, especially to smaller businesses and sole traders. Since there is a big drop in income, there is a high probability of not paying the annuities on time, charging interest... and the banks will get fat again.I propose that the government issue or simply amend a regulation to ensure that the value of the funds deposited in the bank is maintained at the average rate of return on other assets.\n",
      "Banks charge the cost of maintaining the funds and only charge extremely low interest. Banks lending the same funds charge substantial interest, which includes the depreciation of the money with inflation, and the money lent is not the bank's property but is the property of the depositors and other sources. Banks therefore preserve the value of the borrowed funds, but appropriate the result instead of attributing it to the owners. Most people are not aware of this, and the banks take advantage of it, speculatively defrauding depositors.\n",
      "Inflation is not the only sign of value adjustment. The data on house rents shows that money invested in property returns the purchase price of the house after only three years or less - the smaller flats observed. Profitability without real control by the FURS makes this situation possible, and levelling the playing field for everyone is the basic purpose of any state, which also ensures the economic security of its citizens.Many companies will be forced to lay off workers as a result of revenue shortfalls. In order to mitigate the economic damage and the increase in unemployment, I propose that the government, in addition to other measures, temporarily encourage people to take paid and unpaid leave.\n",
      " \n",
      "Particularly in the case of unpaid leave, the current arrangements are inadequate. Unpaid leave represents a cost for both the employer (social insurance) and the employee (pension, parental care and unemployment insurance). An additional problem is the unnecessary administrative complications, since under the current arrangements the employee's contributions have to be paid by the employer, who then has to claim the money from the employee.\n",
      " \n",
      "I propose that the government simplify and incentivise the use of leave for a limited period.

I believe that the current maximum sentence of 5 years is absolutely too low and does not deter the potential perpetrator from the act itself (as evidenced by the increasingly brazen attacks on officials, especially police officers). I suggest a minimum of 1 year in prison as the minimum possible sentence. In these cases, sentences should not be \"suspended\", and the prison sentence itself should not be reduced (e.g. when the convicted person serves only part of the sentence due to \"good behaviour\"). It would also make sense to introduce, in addition to prison sentences, fines, which should not be less than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬1000. When drafting amendments to criminal legislation in this area, the trade unions or associations of the professions concerned should be urgently consulted or involved in the drafting process. The offences in the amended Criminal Code should apply to all offences committed against all the officials mentioned in the Criminal Code (police officers, prosecutors, judges - not just criminal ones!, inspectors, etc.). I further propose to extend the powers of the so called \"judicial police officers\" in the facilities of the judiciary, in the courts... In these facilities, judicial police officers should have all the necessary powers and means of coercion (including weapons and electric stun guns) to carry out the task of guarding the court facilities, the facilities of the prosecutor's office, and perhaps also the Ministry of Justice and the persons employed in these facilities (including prosecutors and judges) - similar to the so-called \"court butler\" in the USA. The security of facilities owned or used by the State authorities, especially those used by the police, the army and the judiciary, should not be provided by private security services, but only by qualified State officials (police officers, soldiers, judicial police officers). The reason for this proposal is, of course, to ensure a certain level of security of these facilities and to ensure the protection of the \"contents\" of these facilities (example - the theft of weapons from the facilities of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior). Knowing that my proposal deals with certain legislative changes that would be \"in favour\" of professions that are not always among the most popular, due to the (also repressive) nature of their work and the attitudes of individuals in the ranks of politicians, I suggest to the \"official readers\" of the proposal from the ranks of the government to consider this proposal anyway, even if it is unlikely to achieve enough \"popular\" votes. Such legislation would allow for greater respect for officials and ensure better exercise of the official powers exercised by individuals in these professions.I propose that all foreign citizens who do not have Slovenian citizenship and are unemployed and receiving social assistance be deported from the Republic of Slovenia to their countries of origin.\n",

Let me also say that my mother and my brother each have their own sole proprietorship and are currently out of work, and consequently out of earnings. I read on the Internet that pensioners and those who already receive social assistance (EUR 400 a month for lying on the sofa???? this does not apply to pensioners) will receive a crisis allowance. I do not understand this, because nothing changes for them, pensioners will still receive their pension, their cost of living will not increase, at most it will decrease, because the government has made the cost of electricity cheaper (commendable). I am not the only student who is without an income (in my case, my mother and brother are also without an income), so I propose, on behalf of everyone, that the extra money that is supposed to be earmarked for pensioners and the socially deprived who are already receiving aid be distributed fairly among the students who have been left without an income. Of course, there are also students who have not worked before, but who are now also finding it harder to support themselves financially, so think of them too. My proposal is really well-intentioned, so that everyone is fairly looked after in these times of crisis, and I realise that it is not easy for you in times like these either, and I support most of the measures that you are taking. Otherwise, I am constantly monitoring the vacancies for students so that they can get into work as soon as possible and secure a monthly income, so that I am not just waiting for the allowances to be handed out by the state.

      "It is this total amount that the employer has to pay for the worker's work or as the entire cost of the worker's work. If the worker had not worked, then the employer would not have had this exact cost (the living wage), which means that the amount of the employer's cost of this work depends precisely on the sum of all the individual components listed, i.e. the net wage and all the benefits it gives rise to. There is also no difference between the employee's and the employer's contributions, both of which go to the State budget as revenue and even for the same purposes. It makes no difference whether the employee's salary is, for example, subject to a total of thirty per cent or to a twofold contribution of fifteen per cent for this purpose.\n",
      "What sense, then, does my proposal make?\n",
      "Neither the workers nor the State would have any problems at all any more as a result of non-payment of payroll taxes by employers, since such non-payment would no longer be theoretically possible. Workers would simply and honestly pay their own contributions and taxes on the basis of the wages they receive. Once they have received their full gross wages from their employer, they would pay the relevant taxes and contributions into the relevant accounts at the prescribed rates. To make it easier for them to do this, the employer would of course help them by calculating and writing the amount of the levy on their payslips and handing them the payslips when they are paid. This would leave the workers with the simple task of physically paying them.\n",
      "The employer would then pay the money intended to cover the full cost of his work to the worker who did the work. In this way, it would be impossible for the employer to avoid the levies on which the work is burdened, which can only be to the benefit of the recipient of the taxes and contributions, i.e. the State. Workers would also benefit considerably, since they would never have to claim from their employers for any unpaid contributions.I propose to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia to impose an unconditional punishment (without prior warning, which has no effect anyway) on all those persons who do not comply with the instructions of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia regarding the quarantine imposed for the new Coronavirus.\n",

Law on Social Security Benefits (ZSVarPre), Page 9195.       I would just like to comment on the two controversial paragraphs in the two articles, even though I am not a lawyer by training, but I think with my own head and, because of my own difficult social situation, I inform myself about the legislation that concerns me - I am a literary person who has the will to think.  Article 23, paragraph 5: 5. a private car or a single-passenger vehicle with a value of up to 28 times the basic minimum income, Explanatory note: This Article therefore states that the applicant may have a private car, while he may not have savings. Yes, what about us almost blind people. That is to say, those who are really deprived should also sell their car first and then apply for social assistance. That does not seem logical to me - yes, a car, no savings, not even a thousand euros - is it not highly illogical?  And Article 36, paragraph (7) If a beneficiary of permanent social assistance or a beneficiary who has received social assistance at least twenty-four times in the three years preceding the application is the owner of immovable property, the decision on entitlement to social assistance shall prohibit him from alienating and encumbering the immovable property of which he is the owner in favour of the Republic of Slovenia.  This seems to me to be, in a sense, a gallant undermining of the modest assets of those small farmers who receive social assistance and who, because of their years, find it difficult to find employment and cannot even survive on a modest, almost market-garden farming income. There will simply be a seal, in legal jargon, put on their property. And you think that social workers are going to warn these simple people about what can happen to them, so that they do not simply have to sell or give away their arable land. The law says nothing about what happens to the seal if people's status improves, if they get a job, if they otherwise recover. I doubt that social workers will have the legal knowledge to be able to advise people on how to get their seals removed if they want to sell the property and thus stop receiving social support for a while. I am surprised that the law applies retrospectively, that is to say, to the time when they were receiving this benefit of tenure, that is to say, to the previous three years, when the law was not yet in force and people were not aware of the legal risks of receiving social assistance. I really find this highly controversial, this retroactive intervention, because the general legal principle, supposedly also under the Constitution, is that new situations are taken into account by the adoption of a new law, not by putting the beneficiaries of social transfers in a matt situation. To be poetic: like this, my darlings, you have been eating the State's cock up to now, and you have fields, do you not. Yes, you go on eating the state bread, but the fields will be ours when you growl. So, if such a law and such an article have already been adopted, and this paragraph asserts the right of the State to put a seal on the non-benefits of beneficiaries who are already having their social contribution reduced as a result of the CC, as much as it is, for example, a meagre EUR 71 for me. The law could have defined things differently, for example, those who will henceforth receive three years of uninterrupted social assistance will get a seal on their immovable property. That would make sense to me, rather than requiring things retrospectively. Nobody is accusing the rich of all sorts of machinations, but that is another story, a completely different story. Poor people's property, let it become state property!    Well, I would have thought it quite appropriate that at least somebody should have read this, because it seems to me that there is, after all, enough sensible subtlety in your institution to understand how laws are sometimes made just like that, over the top.     I find it hard to believe that this writing will generate any response, and perhaps someone will just smile and click and share and it will. Anyway, it seems to me that the state should slowly issue a primer: How to use the state, because even soup in a jar has to have an instruction manual, so why shouldn't the state - a bit of a joke, really, a bit of a joke.\n",

In the Government's latest measure to improve the social situation, there is not a single mention of this group of people. Not now, but in general, this group is completely marginalised. It is not possible to get social assistance, it is not possible to get a care allowance and so on. NOTHING!! Absolutely everybody gets something, only disabled people on the waiting list get nothing! Recently, the government has adopted an increase in the amount of unemployment benefit for those on waiting list(!!!) and in order not to give such disabled people an increase, it has also changed the name of our benefit: no longer a waiting list benefit, but a health insurance benefit. All this in order to deliberately deprive us! Please speed up the process and find a solution as soon as possible!I propose that the government abolish compulsory health insurance contributions from the gross salary and from the gross salary, leaving only the voluntary health insurance we already know as an alternative.

There is also dissatisfaction on the part of clients, who have to suffer long waiting times and are rewarded with annoying doctors. On the other hand, with private doctors, you come straight to the front of the queue, they do the job 200% well and greet you with a smile.

I am an extraordinary student myself and I know that there are not a few of us and that quite a few of us find ourselves in a very unpleasant situation at the moment. There are quite a few of us who feel that this one-off aid of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬150 does not help very much. And there are more. You have forgotten about us - the EXTRAORDINARY students. I have heard comments like \"yes, if they are part-time students it is logical that they have money\". Excuse me? Does anyone ask where we get it? I believe there are many individuals whose parents pay for their studies or at least help them. But on the other hand, there are also those whose parents cannot. Not at all now, in times of epidemic. And who is going to help us? Who are paying for their own studies? When will we also be heard? Not to mention that there are many of us who do not make this our only expense. We also have cars, flats, etc. And no one else will pay for them but ourselves. Well, frankly, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬150 wouldn't help me much either, given my monthly expenses, which are about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬600. And I know that there are not a few of us like that. But we don't need much! I'd be happy just to have the bills, I don't need the rest, or the luxury can wait until it's over.\n",
      "So, the fact is that there are some students (I know a lot of them myself) who are extending their status, lying at home all day, not working through a student and having zero expenses. And such people should get help? Why already? On the other hand, we have students who work a lot more than a normal worker and do part-time studies on top of that, which is not exactly easy either. And we are not worthy of any help? And because of us who work through the student, there are also student services, which could also do something to help us! Not to mention the educational institutions, which are also working at our expense! We pay too much for these part-time studies anyway, and when we need something, there is no one.\n",
      "Well, I am in favour of proposing that everyone should show the decline in their income and be helped on that basis. Or to show their monthly expenses. The best thing would be to also look at the last 6 or 12 months' earnings.\n",

I propose to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure that it should generally ban overtaking by all goods vehicles and vehicles which, by their very nature, have a maximum speed limit for the carriage of goods. This would apply for 24 hours on all sections of motorways. Breaking it would result in heavy penalties for both the driver and the haulier.I suggest for all those employers and workers who work on a part-time basis and there is no possibility of part-time or full-time employment or starting a new job.A 0 hours per week contract,which should be the case,the employer is not obliged to work a certain amount of hours,the worker works when he needs it,so it can be 0-or 40 hours per week depending on the need,overtime does not exist because the worker is paid for all the hours he works,.The wage should be paid every 100 hours -one day,no recourse,no transport reimbursement,snacks can be included or not,all contributions are paid...for pension,health insurance,if the worker is sick,sick pay is not paid...for pension,health insurance,if the worker is sick,sick pay is not paidThere should be security so that the person who has left work and is at home takes care of the parent or parent who provides full care in the home environment, which means that he or she takes care of the child personally, helping him or her with all the basic needs of life, feeding, drinking, dressing and undressing, washing, getting up, moving around, turning around, using the toilet, and keeping him or her safe, further provides her with health care by cooperating with her personal doctor, organising access to the necessary health services, taking prescribed therapy and helping her to take medication, carrying out certain physiotherapy procedures, caring for wounds, preventing and caring for pressure sores, obtaining prescription medicines and assistive devices with a referral (wheelchair, anti bedsore cushion, dressings, nappies, etc.), assists with mobility, assists with the use and cleaning of aids and further provides social care by helping to establish and maintain social and, above all, kinship ties, handles all mail and personal administration, informs the doctor and the matron of the condition and needs, furthermore, provides all the domestic assistance she needs, such as preparing suitable food and drinks for her, as healthily and naturally as possible, maintaining the premises and ensuring that they are adequately heated, making and changing the bed, keeping the premises clean and washing the laundry and clothes, arranging the living environment according to the needs of the parent with disabilities, and so on,If you have a GP and a dentist, and women have a gynaecologist from the public health system, then you pay compulsory health insurance, otherwise you don't. Let's get this sorted out.Why find hot water with a property tax when we already have a building land use allowance. Let it stay as it is, just to change the name is expensive, there are procedures and a lot of administrative procedures and, in the end, court procedures. The result is only congestion in the administration and the courts and an unnecessary burden on the Constitutional Court. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia should take the property tax project off the agenda.I propose to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia to draw up a regulation and to order the Health Insurance Institute and insurance companies covering supplementary insurance to inform the insured person 1 x a year how much he/she has paid for the insurance and how much has been paid for him/her due to an insurance event when he/she visited a doctor and a pharmacy. I believe that the information system allows this and there would be no cost for this, it can be arranged with the cooperation of the FURS and the Health Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Health.Any proposals to increase the RTV contribution should be rejected. The current situation should be remedied by abolishing the compulsory payment of the RTV contribution. With modern technology, it is extremely easy to exclude programmes from the programming scheme. I therefore propose to the Government to abolish the compulsory payment of the RTV contribution and to introduce appropriate technical solutions regarding the restriction of the display of RTV channels.Since most dog owners are completely indifferent when it comes to cleaning up after their dogs, I propose to the government that an environmental tax be introduced for all dog owners, which is then collected by the municipality to clean up the environment (lawns, parks, etc.).\n",

These persons have a registered company in Slovakia and live in Slovenia 365 days a year. They pay no tax here, no registration fee and no other duties. They use our infrastructure, health, education and other services on a daily basis (free of charge).\n",

During these times, goods vehicles should occupy the lane of traffic, while cars should be allowed to drive only in the overtaking lane. This causes congestion (the Ã…Â tajerska AC) of several kilometres, which makes it difficult for all of us commuters to get to work and home every day. The lorries that use our roads at this time are overwhelmingly transit traffic, so the measure would not have a major impact on our hauliers and economy.To improve road safety, we propose that the government adopt a measure banning the use of any vacuum holders on the windscreen of vehicles, as devices such as navigation, mobile phones, smartphones, etc. obstruct the driver's field of vision and, due to their position on the windscreen, automatically divert the driver's attention to them. In the event of an accident, it has also been shown that the device is highly likely to hit the driver or passengers in the head and cause injury.\n",
      " This measure has already been adopted in some other countries (Switzerland, some states in the USA) to improve the safety of the vehicle occupants in the event of an accident, as well as to improve the driver's concentration, where the use of other mounts mounted securely in more suitable positions in the vehicle has been recommended, e.g. in the case of the head restraint.  where there is no risk of the device flying out of the windscreen into the upper body or head area and, above all, where the driver's attention is not distracted during the driving itself, as the devices so placed are not directly in the driver's field of vision.\n",
      "In my opinion, given the less than ideal state of Slovenian roads, the proposal deserves a great deal of attention and serious consideration. As an example, I would cite the use of a small TETRAX magnetic holder, which can be easily placed in the air vent slot or glued to the dashboard, so that the mobile phone or navigation device is closer and within reach, and does not get in the way when driving.

There are also many changes that could be made elsewhere for the better In some homes for the elderly the situation is getting worse. I propose unannounced inspections of care homes, with the findings made publicly available to all users and relatives, to monitor improvements or the implementation of remedial measures.  As a country we could take a range of measures to reduce unemployment in other sectors too, there are many suggestions including cleaning up Slovenia where our country is absolutely thriving from the dirt by the roads and so on ! at the same time also punishing work shirking if you refuse to work you lose all rights !    IN THIS WAY THE AUCTION CAN ALSO SHOW THAT IT CARES ABOUT THE ELDERLY -- WE ALL KNOW THAT NOT ALL ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO LIVE IN A HOME !  THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT PAY THE EXTRA FEES FOR THE ELDERLY WOULD ALSO BE RELIEVED IF IT WAS SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL TO MAKE SUCH WORK COMPULSORY ! Many elderly people want to live in their own homes even though they are helpless - they need a lift to the doctor , to the shops or help with cleaning occasionally at least I hope that these elderly people were working taxpayers who are forgotten by everyone in their old age lpSlovenia's development strategy, like many sectoral strategies, emphasises \"SUSTAINABILITY\" as a desired goal. Sustainable mobility is also included in this framework. The implementation of this sustainable mobility is reflected in the construction of roads (hot topics are: Ljubljana bypass, third development axis, etc.) - which is not very sustainable.

I have also read some studies in which the majority of employers who have decided to promote this see many advantages and do not regret their decision. Japan has even identified the promotion of working from home as a measure to reduce traffic problems. Studies also cite other positive aspects of working from home in terms of people's satisfaction (self-organisation of time, more time for family and leisure activities, etc.), and of course the environment (we are not sufficiently aware of the fact that more than 50% of greenhouse gases come from our vehicles), among other things, it could help to keep the countryside vital (it's not the only solution for young people with an education to move to Ljubljana, etc.)....\n",

      " Following the example of the Scandinavian countries, where until recently it paid not to impose taxes, instead of raising the tax on rents to 30%, Slovenia would reduce the tax to 15% and as a result collect a higher amount of taxes. At 30% we can expect less tax revenue. I would even venture to say that if the tax were reduced to 10%, the tax revenue would be the highest.I propose that a part-time 30 hours a week, with a guaranteed minimum wage, be introduced as soon as possible to make it a full-time job. Anyone who wants a higher wage will be able to work the normal 40 hours, but no longer. The purpose of the measure is to employ additional people and to relieve those who have the lowest and most difficult jobs.  Those who want to earn more will also be more motivated to work more, because they will be able to choose between working 30 hours a month for the same wage, i.e. the minimum wage, as now, or working overtime and thus receiving a higher wage, because it is right that hard-working and industrious people should be rewarded, and that the place should be equalised in some way. Other jobs can also be reduced proportionately, in terms of the deviation from the average job, from 0-30%. The consequence of the measure will be that many people with higher salaries will decide to work only 30 hours, albeit for a lower salary, and the efficiency of the work will in most cases be unchanged, because we know that in certain jobs only 60% of the work is done efficiently, so we are overpaying people for 40% of the work they do not do, while the workers are being exploited to almost 100% and more, because they are also working overtime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. That is why we need to introduce a new norm so that the 30-hour working day is somehow a 100% measure of efficiency, the rest is overtime. And the fact is that more heads know more and more people do more work than one person, so we need to hire more people for shorter hours and give them the opportunity to prove themselves.When calculating the property tax, the carbon footprint of heated buildings should also be taken into account. Buildings with good insulation and a heat pump should pay less tax than those without insulation and heated with oil. An energy performance certificate, which is compulsory for most properties anyway, can help.I propose to abolish the tax on expensive sports cars, for the sake of economic growth. This tax has been in force in Slovenia since 2012 and is calculated according to the engine capacity. Registering an expensive sports car in Slovenia is more expensive than in some other countries, so many Slovenian owners prefer to register their cars abroad, thus losing Slovenia a lot of tax or money. Many owners register them in Slovakia and Germany.For some forms of s.p. (after-hours crafts), there is an additional pension contribution of approx.

After the changes of 1 August 2019, the number of heavy goods vehicles on the road has increased sharply again, virtually overnight, and I do not notice any difference in the number, if I compare the situation today with the situation before 1 June 2019.

They are therefore not car parks. They avoid crossing the border, they destroy the infrastructure and meadows in Slovenia, they leave rubbish behind them - and we do not benefit (at least they pay a parking fee in the car parks set up for them). This is what is happening at the moment, when they have an added exception to cross the Dobovec border crossing, and this is also what happened between June and August, when they were not even allowed to cross that crossing, and they left their vehicles virtually in front of the border.

My proposal is to limit these subsidies to smaller and cheaper vehicles worth up to a maximum of Ã¢â€šÂ¬30 000 excluding VAT. After all, the production of electric vehicles also puts a strain on the environment, and the larger and more expensive these vehicles are, the greater the environmental burden.\n",

There may of course be exceptions to this, e.g. people who have never worked, people who have paid only for a narrower range of benefits, etc.Changes in the economic environment make it pointless to levy crisis taxes.

      "1. abolish DMV altogether, only VAT is paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Individuals can no longer import a car, only companies can do so. This means that VAT would always be payable in Slovenia also on all imported second-hand cars on which no VAT is currently payable in Slovenia. Proof of VAT payment is a prerequisite for registering a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. a ban on the import of vehicles with emissions exceeding Euro 5 or even Euro 6. Very important from an ecological point of view. The average value of the vehicles is also raised and more VAT is charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. ending subsidies on electric vehicles, we will do more for the environment with the restrictions in point 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, this regulation would bring more taxes into the coffers than the current payment of the DMV, because by collecting VAT on even imported second-hand vehicles, we would end up collecting more. Especially if we take into account the \"repatriation\" of all the higher-end vehicles that Slovenians currently drive on foreign plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reflection - Introduce the possibility to deduct VAT if the car is bought by a company and is not used for private purposes.

      "All new cars must be fitted with emergency and pedestrian braking systems. The best system to reduce accidents.I propose that the Labour Inspectorate has 100% of all the powers and that it is not necessary for the worker to go to court to recover his rights (recourse, unpaid work, illegal employment relationship, which includes 40 hours/week student work, etc.) after the visit of the Labour Inspectorate. Instead, the inspection should write a report that is valid.\n",
      "In the event of an illegal employment relationship, the labour inspectorate should immediately have the power to order the employer to pay whatever is due to the worker (regress, holidays, snacks, commuting, wage differential from other employees for the same work) or to remedy other irregularities in the workplace.\n",
      "In this way, many more violations would be corrected, because it would be easier.\n",
      "This would be better both for the State and for the general social security of workers, who are always the weaker link in the employment relationship, as already defined in the Employment Relations Act. This would help and encourage workers to report to the inspectorate, which would then take swift action to ensure that workers' rights are respected. Workers who are victimised would thus avoid being in trouble, lengthy court proceedings and the loss of nerves caused by the length of these proceedings, which is pointless if there is already very strong evidence that can be found by the inspectorate when it visits.\n",
      "I would like to ask for this proposal to be considered, as there are many violations of basic rights at work in Slovenia and this would significantly improve the social situation of workers.since the government is planning to abolish supplementary insurance, why not introduce an additional paid quota? Suppose the price of the insurance covers the basic services (check-up, treatment, hospital, etc.) and the rest (implants, spas, medicines and similar services that are extra) add a payable quota for those who opt for it. This way, you cover the shortfall that will arise and the money can be kept back. You cannot satisfy 400 000 people because it is not right for them. you have to make sure that you cover the money. you give everyone the option of insurance and also allow them to choose whether they want only the basic or the supplementary. you allow children up to the age of 18 to have everything.I propose that all other vehicles on the motorway should also be subject to electronic mileage-based tolling. Where today it is possible to buy a vignette, it should be converted into the sale and refund of darsGo devices....... A DarsGo device can be redeemed for \"perpetual\" or for a limited period of time. A deposit is paid for this time, which is refunded on return......... Such a system is in place in Slovakia for trucks....\n",
      "\n",
      "This system of charging by kilometres is the most cost-effective, as the vignette system benefits the most those who drive the most, and these are mostly the slowest. Those who drive a few times a year, however, are overpaying for the vignette...\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, transit tourists often choose local roads because it is not worth buying a vignette for short distances of up to 100km..... these distances, they would buy a DarsGo device because they would have less cost in tolls than they would in driving longer on ordinary roads...\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, this would mean that, for example, a tourist would buy a DarsGo device for his category of vehicle on Sentil and pay a credit and a refund deposit within 30 days. When returning home, he would return the darsGo device to Sentil and be refunded the remaining balance and deposit..... If the device is not returned within 30 days, the deposit would be automatically collected, which is at least 5x the value of the darsGo device......\n",

      "Lp,I propose to restrict the traffic of goods vehicles during peak hours (e.g. 6:00 - 9:00 and 14:00 - 17:00) on motorways and expressways in the Republic of Slovenia. This could also be done by increasing the toll for lorries by e.g. 2x during these times. This would alleviate daily traffic congestion.I propose to introduce a 10% tolerance of impunity for speeding. It does not matter if the speed limit is 30, 50, 70, 110 or 130 km/h.

      "\n",
      "For speeding above the tolerance, I suggest a small fine of 50eur for speeding between 10 and 25% over the limit. Between 25 and 40% over the tolerance, I propose a large fine of Ã¢â€šÂ¬500 and a warning before the licence is withdrawn. Above 40% speeding, the penalty would be immediate revocation and 200 hours of community service.........The Regulation on working time in public administration bodies provides for a flexible start and allows the head of the administration or another person authorised by him/her to set a different, flexible start and end time for a civil servant. The allocation of full-time working time shall take into account the needs of the working process and shall protect the rights of civil servants to breaks and rest periods. Unless the full-time working time is specifically scheduled by the Head of Unit or by another person under his authority, full-time working time shall be deemed to be scheduled by fixing the start of working time between 07.00 and 09.00 and the end of working time between 15.00 and 17.30 or on Fridays between 14.30 and 16.30. The obligatory working hours of a civil servant shall be from 09.00 to 15.00 and until 14.30 on Fridays. Civil servants working in the administrative units and regional units of the authorities shall have irregular full-time working hours, with a floating start between 7.00 and 8.00 and a floating end between 15.00 and 16.30 on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, between 18.00 and 18.30 on Wednesday, between 13.00 and 14.30 on Friday and between 12.00 and 12.30 on Saturday.

      "I believe that the average citizen visits and needs the services of the administrative unit or the social work centre more often than the court. Given that these state bodies operate normally with their own timetables, I see no reason why the courts should not do the same. Longer opening hours on Wednesdays would also make it easier for clients to deal with court matters.\n",
      "This would make it easier for court staff to balance their private and professional lives, which is difficult with the current timetable. The winter months in particular (school, kindergarten, shorter days, etc.) have a worse impact on the psychological state of the individual, as he or she finishes work when it is already dark and is practically at work all day. Many staff members are also commuters and need extra time to get to and from work. There is no doubt that a different court timetable would have a major impact on the quality of life of the staff member, better working efficiency and a positive working climate. Mandatory presence of a civil servant at work from 09.00 to 15.00 and until 13.00 on Fridays would also allow for the smooth running of office hours. This change in working hours is made in order to promote a work-life balance for staff, as there is a lot of talk these days about flexibility, which is not felt by the staff of the courts.Dear Sir or Madam,\n",

      "As the title says, I would like to propose a mileage allowance for civil servants whose one-way commute by public transport takes more than 90 minutes. At least 8% of the price of a litre of NMB 95 as a rule, as is already the case for commuting where there is no public transport option.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, for public servants living in Maribor and working in Ljubljana, the train is accepted as an acceptable means of transport for commuting, with a journey time of approximately 180 minutes for locations more than one station away from the main railway station; not to mention delays. So 8 hours of work + 6 hours of travel and that leaves 10 hours for family life, the latter including sleep. And the lack of time for family, sport and rest itself brings with it many other things. So the actual rest between the time such a civil servant has to travel and the time he gets home is at most 10 hours. Thus, there is a need for a change in the interpretation or the provision of Article 155 of the ZDR-1 itself, because there is no rest when you are just on your way home.\n",

      "The fact is that Slovenia is a centralised country and so the civil service has to recruit all over Slovenia, and the fact is that people like to work, but you cannot treat a worker who has a 15-minute journey to work and a worker who has a three-hour journey to work in the same way; their quality of life is not the same!\n",

Land value tax would also be an additional burden on the socially disadvantaged, and a minimum cost would be calculated each year. All citizens in employment, actively seeking work or declared unfit for work, and whose income would not exceed the value of the minimum wage plus the newly calculated costs, would be proportionally exempted from the land tax. An example is given below for further explanation:\n",

      "The Republic of Slovenia currently has more than 6 000 000 properties and a population of just over 2 000 000 inhabitants, the number of which has not increased significantly in recent years, yet property prices are constantly rising, far outstripping inflation. It is therefore clear that the housing crisis will not be solved by building new housing, as there is already more than enough of it. A new financing structure would therefore allow for more favourable house prices for first home buyers, with more emphasis on land and property values. It would promote efficient use of land and development in less developed parts of the Republic of Slovenia and raise funds in a fairer way.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sudden implementation of the proposal would mean a major change from the point of view of both municipalities and citizens, I propose that the change be introduced gradually, with an appropriate transition period of 4 years.I suggest that the Government considers the following proposal. There are quite a lot of people in the RS who receive social support of one kind or another. When processing an application, the competent authority obtains practically all the information about the individual, the family in terms of financial situation and income. The next step could be to adopt legislation to the effect that if an individual violates positive legislation (commits or has committed a crime or misdemeanour), his or her social assistance would be reduced in proportion to the violation. Quite simply. Thus, individuals would be forced to comply with the law if they wanted to receive social assistance. If they were unable to look after their children because they had no income (they were too diligent in committing crimes - misdemeanours), the social services would take care of them. Such irresponsible parents really cannot bring up their children, because they will be even more prone to breaking the law and harming people who, by working hard, contribute money to the budget.\n",
      "I realise that the proposal is very sloppily written, but what it would achieve is that individuals would not deliberately break the law because they would fear for their cash income from social transfers. The fact is that we all pay for social transfers, we are all employed, we pay taxes, etc. It is completely incomprehensible that an individual who receives money from social transfers is doing harm (offences, crimes) against the society that contributes money to him. What we are witnessing today is an individual who receives more than the minimum wage in social transfers and who commits various crimes or offences to increase this amount significantly. Let social assistance really be for those who need it, and not for those who enrich it by causing harm to the rest of the working population of the Republic of Slovenia.I propose that the public be legally allowed to consult the Register of Motor Third Party Liability Insurance and Motor Third Party Insurance claims, with limited data (protection of personal data), of course.\n",

      "What is missing is information on any road accidents the vehicle has been involved in. Vehicles can therefore be sold as undamaged, but the buyer cannot verify this information. This leads to misleading and detrimental effects on buyers, as well as hidden defects and the associated risk of further accidents.\n",
      "The Slovenian Insurance Association already maintains a register of claims under the law, but access to the data is only available to victims of a car accident.\n",
      "The Act on Compulsory Motor Insurance does not provide a legal basis for making the data from the claims register open and accessible to the public.\n",
      "I propose that the public be given limited access to the Register of Damages by law, either through an online service or through a database.\n",
      "The data should include at least the VIN number of the vehicle, and the date of the accident. The amount of the claims would also be welcome, as would any information that further clarifies the nature and extent of the damage to the vehicle. Personal data (insurance policy holder, etc.) should remain inaccessible to the public.The real estate law, which is partly labelled as unconstitutional, still has a couple of articles that have a big impact on homeowners who rent out their flats while renting elsewhere.\n",

      "\n",
      "But, in addition to the tax on renting out the property, the landlord also pays property tax.\n",

At present, it is only implemented in certain municipalities.I propose an eco-tax for the first internal combustion passenger cars of Ã¢â€šÂ¬200 per year.

      " For several years now, since the last financial crisis, traffic on Slovenian roads (especially on the roads leading into Ljubljana and on the ring road) has been increasing by several % every year. It is well known that public transport in Slovenia is not keeping pace with the increase in transport demand, and it is therefore urgent that, while continuing to develop public transport, active work on congestion management should be undertaken as a stepping stone, as reducing congestion would make a significant contribution to the economic and social well-being of the citizens. In large European cities, congestion management is addressed through pricing policies, i.e. whoever wants to travel at peak times pays more, hence the existence of several types of tickets. Visitors (especially tourists) to London have to pay significantly more for a public transport ticket to ensure that they can travel even during the rush hour (7:30-9:30 in the morning and 16:40-18:30 in the afternoon).\n",

      "2) Increasing the cost of non-urgent non-freight journeys, such as tourist transit. As we know, Slovenia is a very transit-oriented country. A vignette for the use of Slovenian roads would therefore exclude driving at peak times. Everyone would have to secure an additional \"pass\" to drive at peak times.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The same measure as in point 2) could be introduced for all road users on the roads covered by the vignette in the current system.Hello,\n",
      "Pension policy does not take into account people who are in some way receiving social contributions in an undue way. Unmanaged in the sense that these people claim that they do not want to go to work in any way. Verified - I personally know of 2 cases where this is the case. It has also been reported in the media that a family of 3 has more social benefits than a family of 3 where at least one member works. So those who are working will have to work longer and longer to get their pensions with the new pensions policy, but at the same time we have more and more people who could work but don't want to, and manage to get social benefits. I personally know that such a person, for example, gets a newly renovated flat, for which he pays no rent, gets a social contribution, and lives modestly but comfortably, on a new sofa, in a warm flat (about 43 m3), with a new lcd screen, etc.\n",
      "Not all recipients of social contributions are in the same position, some are really managed to them. But how many of those who could work, are salaried, but under the cover of excuses do not work, and have no intention of ever working.\n",
      "At the same time, the number of employees in such state offices is not going to increase either, so there is no possibility of there being a team of people to check these things. There are no mechanisms, so it is all an end in itself, and that has long been a systemic flaw that perhaps no one wants to point out. Now is the time to bring pension policy into line with all the parameters, to make it as socially just as possible, as far as possible, for everyone.The trial valuation that is underway has anomalies, some properties do not even have an established value (no data), a set of identical properties of the same m2 e.g. garages in a set all different values and significant discrepancies, not to mention apartments, properties wrongly inventoried, even duplicated values, etc. I suggest to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia that it re-inventories the properties accurately, so that each property has a specific and correct indication of how many basements, garages and fire rooms, storerooms and staircases and corridors are in a given property and how many rooms and kitchens there are in reality.The ZDR-1 stipulates that an employer may not terminate the employment contract (serve notice of termination) of an employee during pregnancy, of an employee who is breastfeeding a child up to one year of age, and of parents during the period when they are taking parental leave (maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave) in the form of full absence from work in a consecutive series, and for one month after the leave has been taken. During this period and in these cases, the employer may not do anything that would otherwise be necessary to terminate the contract of employment or to recruit a new employee. However, the special protection against dismissal for parents and pregnant workers does not apply if there are grounds for extraordinary dismissal (with the prior agreement of the Labour Inspector) or for the opening of proceedings for the dissolution of the employer. The above protection for these categories of workers therefore also applies in the case of unsuccessful probationary work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ZDR-1 has introduced a number of changes in the area of probationary work. Under the previous regime, unsuccessful completion of probationary work was a ground for extraordinary termination of the employment contract, which, in conjunction with Article 115, meant that the employer could terminate the employment contract of a pregnant worker on the grounds of unsuccessful completion of probationary work, subject to the prior consent of the labour inspector. However, the failure to successfully complete the probationary period is now a ground for regular termination of the employment contract (new Article 89(1)(5)), with the employee being entitled to seven days' notice (Article 94(1)). In this respect, the wording of Article 115 has not changed as regards the protection of parents against dismissal or termination of the employment contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, the latter is completely \"unviable\" for the employer, since in such a case the employer cannot actually make use of the already agreed probationary work (even more problematic is the situation where such circumstances would have existed at the time of the conclusion of the contract, but the employee would have concealed them). The same opinion is also shared by the Head of the Legal, Human Resources and General Affairs Department of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who states in an expert article: \"There is no case law on the protection of pregnant workers and parents in the event of unsuccessful probationary work, but in my opinion, according to the purpose and logic of probationary work and the fact that the contract is concluded on a terminable basis, it would not be logical to protect these categories of workers from termination of their contracts for unsuccessful probationary work.\" It should be noted that the assessment of probationary work would be based on the actual performance of the employee and would not be based on the fact that she is pregnant or for any of the other reasons mentioned above. In the event that the probationary employee is negatively evaluated and one of the above categories applies, the employer would have no choice but to have an employee on the payroll who is not performing his/her job adequately or in accordance with the employer's expectations. The latter situation is absurd and leads to the abolition of the agreed probationary work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the purpose of probationary work and the encouragement of employers to conclude contracts of indefinite duration, I propose to the Government that regular dismissal for failure to complete probationary work be reinstated as an exception and included among the grounds where the special protection of protected categories against dismissal does not apply (i.e. Article 115(5) of the ZDR-1).In Ljubljana, a large number of parking machines are coin-operated only and do not accept coins of smaller denominations. The new machines will not accept smaller denominations either. I suggest that the government ensure that at least municipally owned machines accept legal tender - smaller denomination coins. As an alternative to this proposal, I have in the past sent a proposal that 1 and 2 cent coins should not be put into circulation and that the final amounts of cash payments should be rounded up to 5 cents, which has already been rejected by government representatives with the fallacious argument that this is not possible, even though it has already been done in FInland, Belgium, Ireland, partly in Italy and the Netherlands.I propose to abolish the cost of identifying a person when changing ownership of a vehicle, as this charge of around Ã¢â€šÂ¬6 per person is pure theft.\n",

The other classes should also be adjusted or redefined, as the current tariff is extremely high for some, irrespective of the kilometres travelled.

      "Pension policy does not take into account people who are in some way receiving social contributions in an undue way. Unmanaged in the sense that these people claim that they do not want to go to work in any way. Verified - I personally know of 2 cases where this is the case. It has also been reported in the media that a family of 3 has more social benefits than a family of 3 where at least one member works. So those who are working will have to work longer and longer to get their pensions with the new pensions policy, while at the same time we have more and more people who could work but don't want to, and manage to get social benefits. I personally know that such a person, for example, gets a newly renovated flat, for which he pays no rent, gets a social contribution, and lives modestly but comfortably, on a new sofa, in a warm flat (about 43 m3), with a new lcd screen, etc.\n",

If it is found that such a person could work and thus fill the state coffers, instead of receiving from the state indefinitely, that person should be actively involved in finding a job (statistics say that there is a shortage of certain profiles of professionals, but it is a pity that only such people receive the social contribution, instead of being in regular employment, because they are able to do so). The unemployment rate may rise, but the percentage of people on social benefits will fall, and so will the warning to others that you have to work to get a pension. However, if the state extends the time limit for pensions, it will also be at the expense of those who are not receiving social benefits properly but are able to work.\n",
      "I will hardly write a definitive systemic solution myself, but I have pointed to the guidelines for such a solution.After the unsuccessful negotiations with Fides on the introduction of austerity measures to reduce doctors' overtime pay, it became clear in the first days of September how urgently needed structural changes in the health network are, in particular, to ensure the conditions for the sustainability of the health budget. It is essential that hospital managements make a realistic assessment of the capacities at their disposal and the extent to which they can normally provide their services in relation to their own staffing levels. A restructuring programme should be drawn up in all health care institutions and a realistic timeframe should be set for the transition period in terms of staffing or the closure or merging of hospital departments. Health insurance should make it clear as soon as possible that it will not recognise disproportionate increases in hospital bed-times for services provided by hospitals.\n",

Truck queues on the AC during peak hours (especially in the morning between 6-8am) are a daily occurrence, which further causes congestion, as the right lane is often fully occupied by trucks, leaving only one lane of the motorway for cars to drive. The vast majority of this freight traffic is transit traffic and does not carry perishable goods, so it would not make a significant difference for them to start their journey after 8am. Similarly, on these main roads leading out of Ljubljana, freight traffic could be restricted between 15.30 - 17.00.My suggestion is to pay from gross salary/pension... instead of supplementary health insurance, because it will be less noticeable to employees, and net pay correspondingly less. But we would pay depending on the level of gross salary - 2 percent.

      " On the one hand, we have a lot of people in this country who are lonely, unemployed, want to spend their time in a useful way, or simply want to do something for others directly, not just by donating. On the other hand, we have overworked, overheated, underpaid workers in old people's homes, kindergartens, hospitals, youth centres, etc. Why not introduce regulated and systematised voluntary work, which would relieve the burden on full-time employees, help cover absences on holidays and public holidays, and relieve loneliness and make many people's days more meaningful?\n",
      "The system could work something like this: you sign up for a specific type of work (e.g. in a retirement home), go through a short induction (this is where the state should step in and organise coordinated inductions in local communities), pay a nominal induction fee and get a \"volunteer badge\" which obliges you to do xy hours of volunteering per year. If you don't, you lose the badge and have to go through induction again. Perhaps one of the volunteers could then find a regular job in one of these institutions, get some experience, etc.\n",

At the moment I have young children and no free time, but when they are grown up I would be happy to spend a certain number of hours each week volunteering, rather than sitting in front of the TV. I don't need the extra money, I love my job, but sometimes I miss the contact with people and the feeling that I have done something good for someone. Of course, we can always volunteer in this way, without systematisation, but I still think that such a system would be welcome, it would make it easier to find both the volunteers and the institutions that need such help, and by introducing it, we would somehow weed out people who might not be suitable for this kind of work.\n",
      " Motor Vehicle Tax (MVT) is payable on vehicles put into circulation or registered for the first time in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, for vehicles falling under certain tariff codes as defined in the European Community Customs Tariff. The VAT is payable on the taxable amount, which is the sales value of the motor vehicle, excluding value added tax (VAT) and this tax.\n",
      "The rate of the tax depends on a number of factors depending on the type and characteristics of the vehicle (type of vehicle, propulsion of the vehicle, CO2 emissions, EURO emissions, etc.) and is more precisely defined in the Law on the Tax on Motor Vehicles (Official Journal of the RS, No 72/06 - Official consolidated text, 9/10 and 40/12 - ZUJF).\n",
      "I propose a reduction or a return to the pre-crisis level (i.e. the situation before the amendments were adopted in 2012). In fact, publicly available records show a huge decline in the number of newly registered vehicles of a higher price class (according to the criteria of the current law). We can also observe a number of bypasses that are taking place with the use of leasing and various rentals of foreign vehicles for private use of vehicles in road transport. If we compare the level of taxation with more developed neighbouring countries, we can see that we are much more heavily taxed than the Austrians or the Germans. The state is certainly not making any additional gains by pursuing a repressive policy of levying charges, especially not in the conjunctural times that we have experienced over the last few years.\n",
      "Just consider the following example. When we buy a car that has certain characteristics (volume, power, emission levels, etc.), we buy additional equipment, such as bigger wheels, leather seats or more powerful brakes. Due to the current legislation, we will pay up to 54% extra tax on the sale price for such an extra (up to 62% on diesel engines), if the above-mentioned characteristics are in the highest tariff bracket.\n",
      "Such a tax regime is certainly not optimal and is unacceptable to the average citizen.On 1 April next year, we will have a new traffic law, and with it, higher penalties. These will hit especially offenders who can cause the worst accidents by driving in a distracted and irresponsible way.\n",

      "In addition to the above solutions, I propose upgrading or building new passenger lines in the vicinity of Ljubljana to speeds of 160km/h and a correspondingly smaller number of stations (marked with larger circles in the annex). This would separate passenger rail traffic from freight traffic and allow for higher capacities for both the main freight lines (red in the annex) and the passenger lines (yellow), and in the area of concentrated population in Ljubljana, the Ljubljana Metro would run on the passenger line (smaller circles in the annex). The larger stations would be designed as park & drive, i.e. you could drive to the station, park and transfer to the train, and with increased speeds and direct lines, the train would be the fastest option and a tempting alternative.\n",
      "My personal opinion is that the proposed expansion of the AC sections near LJ to six lanes is a waste of money and will not solve traffic congestion, it will only divert more migration to the roads (for those who are interested in more, you can read what induced demand is and how it affects the roads), as traffic congestion on the roads is a reflection of poor rail infrastructure and lack of alternatives, not poor road infrastructure. Building two extra lanes of road increases capacity by around 2000 vehicles in one direction in one hour, by comparison a double-track railway can carry over 20000 passengers smoothly in one hour.\n",
      "I would also mention that the Ljubljana rail network is part of several corridors and could use a lot of EU funding to renew the lines, and that it is the busiest network in Slovenia and therefore needs to be upgraded, but it is also the most profitable sections.I propose that athletes with permanent residence in Slovenia should be taxed only with a 5% tax on income over 100,000 euros......\n",

The very base of training and preparation for foreign football clubs is a good example of good practice, including Planica, where a lot of foreign winter athletes train.... Lowering taxes would only increase interest.....Since wages are generally not rising in line with GDP growth (only exceptionally for managers), companies are exploiting the labour force in terms of the less active population, who have to work for three or more people, are in illegal employment, etc., and costs (housing, food, clothing) are rising, in line with income data from the Social Insurance Institution (ZPIZ), we should limit price rises and set a ceiling for the price of all costs. While the ZPIZ seemingly acts only as a data collector on wages and other benefits and expenses, I suggest that it should recruit experts who could evaluate the actual situation of the wage-cost ratio, which would ultimately result in reasonable prices for rents, property prices and household expenses. I believe that there is still too much variation in consumption in apartment blocks and that they do not show the real state of energy consumption in terms of saving on water consumption, etc. We should also limit property prices and rents in this way, because they do not promote a decent life for young people, the elderly or the old. So for the whole population, we can no longer say who is worse off, to be honest. We need to increase the control of non-compliance with the law, if it were implemented in terms of price caps, because if we were also to limit the disparity between wage ratios by law, we would not be tolerating poverty and we would not be tolerating precarious work. Why is it that a manager is so capable that he can literally have 10 times or more the wage of a worker, regardless of the type of education. What I observe is that the differences are huge, whatever the level of education and whatever the type of work. I propose that, also for managers, in the private sector, the salary of managers should be capped, as this could allow for greater employability, which is more necessary than managers having such high salaries. I believe that the current economy, which is in favour of competitiveness, does not see that, by not restricting capital, it is allowing capital to flow abroad. In addition, it is no wonder that illegal work is also being encouraged. I wonder whether we are really following the example of the northern European countries or whether we just want to do this and do nothing about it. What I can suggest to people is that we limit our purchases and do not go shopping every day if we can. We did not elect the shops to be open all the time, did we? I do not think we can sell everything, or we can.Aircraft are a major source of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. It would be appropriate for Slovenia to propose or demand a tax on kerosene and airline tickets.I suggest that financial incentives for people to take part in sport should be introduced to help reduce health problems in the long term.\n",

Parking fines and automatic speed cameras have been taken over by traffic wardens, who measure in the easiest locations (where they expect the most fines), which are not necessarily the most dangerous. All the more serious offences (alcohol, speeding elsewhere, tailgating, wrong way, etc.) go unpunished because there is no policeman to see and punish.\n",
      "I propose that the money from fines for more serious offences (say those with a prescribed 5 penalty points or more) should be funnelled back into the police force as money for new recruits, and also for salary bonuses for the police officers who are most effective at such punishment.\n",
      "Limiting it to more serious offences is necessary, because otherwise (i.e. if all the money from all the fines were to flow back to the police) we would end up with a case of \"just to find something\". This would give us more staff, who would have a greater interest in catching the worst offenders (i.e. those who are the most dangerous in traffic).The e-tax website is an idea in the right direction. Unfortunately, the site is completely user-unfriendly. You have to click through a maze of words to find what you need to pay (contributions, income tax). If things were simplified so that even those of us who are more skilled in something other than bureaucracy could manage them without a problem, more money would flow into the public coffers. It is not logical that an entrepreneur should have to work so hard to pay something to the state. It would be more productive for the entrepreneur, and for the State, if the entrepreneur spent his time on his business, which he knows, earned as much as possible and paid his obligations in a straightforward manner.I notice that vehicles with halogen bulbs illuminate the road in front of the vehicle very poorly and even in the rain it is vedlivosk 0 (glare) compared to vehicles equipped with led or xenon lights. I know the problem with upgrading to blind vehicles going in the opposite direction (this is only true if the vehicle does not have a lens). So I propose to allow upgrading lights without any problem or need for any allowed, only for vehicles equipped with lenses (like the main light) so that the visibility is better and does not disturb other oncoming vehicles. Because even new vehicles have led lights without headlight washers or automatic beam height adjustment (renult e.g. clio, suzuki... (which I know they have)).\n",

You have compared a bunch of countries, you have made a comparison and, of course, you have not taken into account the standard and purchasing power. And you must have deliberately left out countries where there is no tax.\n",
      "You have already made a mistake once, you have collected significantly less tax than you wanted. Now you are burdening all classes, including those who buy cheap cars. And that is supposed to be the appropriate long-term solution?\n",
      "If we are going to have free movement of goods in the EU, such taxation is illogical. They inhibit purchasing power, money flows out of the country. When you understand this simple thing, you might abolish the clumsy taxes that serve no one. People will stop buying, you will spend the money on inspections, and the piggy bank will remain empty.\n",
      "The tax you have proposed should be reduced by at least a third, and even abolished for newer vehicles. This is taking into account all the revenue that will be generated by the increased sales, which is mainly VAT, excise duties and all the other taxes that car companies pay into the Treasury every month.\n",

Credit can only be taken against all co-owners of the property, even if some of them do not need it.

      "The legislator is forcing owners who do not need credit to buy something (in this case credit) that they do not need. This imposes an additional unnecessary cost on these homeowners, which reduces their financial capacity. I ask those responsible, is it constitutionally permissible in the country of Slovenia to force a free citizen to buy something he does not need?\n",
      "I suggest that the state solves the problem by allowing homeowners who cannot afford the large one-off cost to take out a loan on more favourable terms. It should not, however, force other homeowners to solve the financial problem of their neighbour in the property.During the crisis, an additional tax on vessels longer than 5m was adopted.\n",

      "2. The average value of Slovenian seafarers' vessels is less than Ã¢â€šÂ¬20,000.\n",
      "So the additional tax on vessels (also called prestige tax by some) is completely unjustified, as the average value of a vessel:\n",
      "- lower than the price of a mid-range car,\n",
      "- lower than the value of a bungalow or a cottage,\n",
      "- the equivalent of many hobbies or sporting activities, both in terms of cost, social value, etc.\n",
      "There are a lot of sea-goers, with boats over 30 years old, whose value does not even exceed Ã¢â€šÂ¬5,000, but they still pay the \"prestige tax\", even if they leave the last euro in the marina and the nautical shops (VAT!). Many of them are pensioners, for whom seafaring means being active, moving in the fresh air, socialising with friends ...\n",

      "1. that the current rate of DMV (Motor Vehicle Tax) be reduced from 0.5% to 0% for all purchases of electric vehicles that have no direct emissions.\n",

      "The tax credit proposal makes sense to me, as it would help to speed up the transition to electric and environmentally friendly vehicles, which are currently quite expensive.

      "At a time when the current political issue is the abolition of supplementary health insurance and the introduction of a compulsory contribution to health insurance with a solidarity scale according to income, we should consider whether the level of benefits is sufficient to determine the level of the compulsory contribution. The fact is that users of health services have very different lifestyles and habits and thus very different levels of risk of disease. A one-size-fits-all contribution, or a solidarity scale that takes into account only income, is discriminatory, since it treats drinkers and teetotallers, smokers and non-smokers, overweight and underweight people, walkers and those who enjoy risky adrenaline sports, etc., in the same way. The solidarity scale should therefore also introduce a kind of lifestyle risk index, determined by each person's personal or treating doctor, which would affect the amount of the individual's health insurance contribution. Thus, anyone whose risky lifestyle exposes them to diseases caused by alcohol, smoking, obesity, etc., would have to pay a correspondingly higher contribution. This is because such illnesses cost the Health Insurance Fund hundreds of millions a year, and at present all such costs are covered in solidarity by the same contribution, which means discriminatory treatment for all those with a risk-free lifestyle. If all those whose lifestyles put them at high risk of morbidity were charged an appropriately high contribution, this could probably induce many people to change their lifestyles, which would in turn bring non-negligible savings to the NHIF coffers and reduce the burden on the health service.\n",
      "Best regards,I propose that the Government, through the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Ministry of Health, implement a regulation requiring large public notices to be placed for people approaching the test area of electro-magnetic radiation suspected of being harmful to health. In Ljubljana, the MOL collects a fee for the placement of the notice, which is paid by the owner of the property on which the MOL has allowed the EM radiation sources to be placed. Human experimentation is prohibitedToday's house prices are, to put it simply, the result of too much demand and too little supply. I will outline my proposal below, but unfortunately it is not without a little background.\n",
      "Housing oversupply is an issue that has been going on for decades (the attachment shows the number of new homes built by time period), but it has really come to the fore in the last few years. All the developable land in the major centres has already been subdivided and built on, and the owners have no interest in selling. As a result, it is rare for investors to get their hands on cheap land in city centres and then not be able to exploit the land to its full potential due to strict building laws and restrictions on new developments by the local population.\n",
      "We Slovenians ourselves are to blame for the over-increase, because we want to invest every euro we have in real estate. The result is that today more than 300 000 Slovenians own more than four properties, and even more own three or two. As a result, even the few newly built homes are being bought up by those who already own property and are paying off their loans by renting them out. And so a vicious circle is created, where house prices are constantly rising and young people are finding it harder and harder to get a home of their own.\n",
      "My proposed solution:\n",
      "- Taxing all residential property except the first one with a 2% property tax would make buying a second property a bad investment and Slovenians would invest their money elsewhere.\n",
      "- A much higher compensation for the use of building land would force owners of poorly used land in cities to sell their land to investors.\n",
      "- Cities that are the centres of cohesion regions would become special zones, the size of which would be proportional to the population of the region, and building legislation would be relaxed in these zones.\n",
      "- The new revenue from property tax and building land allowance could be used to abolish income and corporate taxes, which would raise the standard of living for Slovenians.\n",
      "Low property prices should be in the interest of all Slovenians. The advantages of agglomeration are lower energy consumption and environmentally friendly policies, higher economic growth at the expense of less money spent on maintenance of local infrastructure, fewer young people going abroad in search of better opportunities, higher birth rate of first property owners, better health of people (less anxiety, depression, asthma, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, etc.), etc...Just over 100 people a year die from bad air. Problems are manifesting themselves in several cities around the world (BIH, Serbia, Italy, China, India, etc.) and in Germany, they have started to restrict the use of disels. This is not possible here, because the central vehicle register does not contain this information (whether it is diesel or petrol), and I suggest that this be properly regulated and that work be started once and for all to ensure that we live in a clean environment, and that we do not live in a city where 130000 cars are driven into the city every day, polluting, and the citizens of Ljubljana are on foot and on bicycles.\n",
      "Changes are needed and, unfortunately, because people choose luxury rather than to adapt and do something for the environment, restrictive measures are needed. After all, we only have one earth.\n",
      "If anyone can do it, it is us, alone. The air in Slovenian cities is getting worse, mainly because of traffic, combustion and industry. We can do a lot about traffic ourselves, but there is no interest, so we have to follow Berlin.\n",

      " I propose the possibility of accessing all vehicle inspection certificates and checking the meter reading using only the VIN No.\n",
      "This would facilitate everyone's decision to buy used vehicles and of course the difficulty in ascertaining the condition of the vehicles (history). h short access to all vehicle data (for which currently a registration number and a plate number are required).\n",
      "the second point is however the powers and responsibility of the TP service, namely upon acceptance of the vehicle for TP management the status of the no no. is checked and entered in the system which checks and displays the entire history of the entries and in case of deviation (lower no.) the vehicle is automatically detained until the postponement of the evidence (maybe engine change) and of course the responsible service is immediately informed (police) which then also makes a proposal for a crime/fraud and is punished accordingly and in the case of the seller (company, shop, s.In this way, and only in this way, can we protect and ensure a fairly safe and reliable information for each customer and reduce the possibility of fraud.\n",

      "currently the link autolog.si is quite useful, the only problem is the accessibility to the TP documents (certificates) and the slow updating of the database (once a year it is updated ...).I appeal to the government to systematically regulate the control of retail chains that regularly cheat with discounts and mislead the consumer, the penalties should be a % of gross turnover, as in other countries, because retail chains in Slovenia too often artificially increase prices by 100% and then reduce them by 30%-50%. In this way, they mislead or cheat the consumer, most often those who are least well-off. Since this is dirt, sleaze and deception of consumers, of the people, high fines should also be introduced as a percentage of gross turnover, and criminal liability should be imposed on all those involved, not just on the director.I propose that a new regulation or an amendment to the existing one be made for the carrying out of vehicle roadworthiness tests, linked to the actual kilometres travelled, separately for cars and lorries.\n",
      "I propose the following system:\n",
      "Passenger cars: no MOT required up to 100,000 km, then every 40,000 km thereafter up to 300,000 km and every 20,000 km thereafter over 300,000 km.\n",
      "Light goods vehicles up to 3.5T: no TP required up to 100,000km, then every 40,000km for every 80,000km thereafter up to 340,000km for every 40,000km thereafter.\n",
      "Heavy goods vehicles over 3.5T: TP every 100,000km up to a total of 500,000km and every 50,000km thereafter\n",
      "A system should be introduced to record the total kilometres driven at the time of the TP for each vehicle separately, linked to the vehicle's body number, with the possibility to consult it at the time of sale - purchase of a second-hand vehicle.\n",
      "This would prevent owners from resetting the actual mileage of the vehicle at the time of sale and, in my opinion, unnecessary technical inspections of vehicles that do not cover nearly the number of km in a year that would require them to have a MOT according to the above norms.\n",
      "Of course, the system of actual kilometres driven and, consequently, the TP is also adjusted accordingly.Many of you have been in a collision with a vehicle or have a vehicle whose lights are very dim and you can see practically nothing in front of you. You have tried the much-vaunted LED daytime running lights, which are great, but the problem is that they are not legal, so you have no choice but halogen daytime running lights (original), which give off a very poor light. With bad headlights you endanger your safety and the safety of other road users who may be overlooked because of the poor illumination. I therefore propose that the Government introduce a special technical inspection where you could fit LED or HID headlights to your vehicle, which would then be checked by apparatus to see if they are sufficient and correct and do not dazzle passing motorists, which you would pay for, and if the headlights were suitable and safe for use on the road, you would be given a special card authorising the use of these headlights in your vehicle in traffic.In addition to the existing fines for speeding drivers, I propose to introduce a system of recording speeding and, consequently, entering the reduced - limited - speed limit for the driver as a percentage of the generally applicable speed limit on the driver's licence. The limit should be marked on the vehicle with a penalty sticker for the duration of the penalty.\n",
      "e.g.: Anyone who commits the offence of speeding more than 10Ã‚Â°% of the speed limit should, in addition to the fine, be given a record of his speed limit being -10% lower than the current speed limit, which would mean that he has to drive everywhere 10% slower than everyone else because he would otherwise be in contravention. His vehicle would also have to have penalty stickers visible to all road users.It proposes to sanction serious offences, including by confiscating the vehicle.\n",
      "These would be offences such as: driving in the opposite direction on the motorway, exceeding the speed limit by 100% or more, unregistered vehicles, driving in a quantity for which the current law already provides for the withdrawal of the driving licence. Possibility of public auction of the vehicle, after one year from the date of withdrawal.\n",
      "The reason, simple. Look at how traffic has calmed down where the cops are lying. Because, for many people, a car means more than a fine, because they have too much money or too little.\n",
      "That is why I think it would be a good idea to pass a law that would hit offenders on the car, because that has been proven to work. Lying cops.\n",
      "The fine is only for the poor.Dear Sir or Madam,\n",
      "I would like to draw your attention to the following. As full-time employees with a supplementary activity (after-hours s.p.), we already pay basic health insurance on our salaries and, as individuals, supplementary health insurance separately. As an after-hours sole trader (for activities outside work), we pay monthly benefits to ZPIZ (EUR 33,90) and ZZZS (EUR 35,53), which provide us with little or nothing. They do not count towards our working time, nor do they provide us with any additional or complementary health services (as we are already insured for the latter as part of our regular job), which means that we are paying for something that we have nothing to gain from. I believe that there are quite a few afternoon S.P.'s and that all of us who faithfully pay the pointless charges could at least be exempted from paying for supplementary health insurance. Someone who is in full-time employment pays compulsory health insurance with his gross salary, but pays supplementary health insurance separately. Someone who is a classic sole trader pays the compulsory health insurance as part of the sole trader's contributions, and the supplementary health insurance separately. A part-time s.p., on the other hand, pays compulsory health insurance already with his regular gross salary at work, plus supplementary insurance as an individual and \"health insurance\" as a part-time s.p., but despite the double payment, is treated no differently from the first two categories.\n",

      "They are doing harm not to themselves, but to the worker, who does not receive a higher wage than he could have received if the company had not given him a minimum wage supplement.\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "A worker has a contract stating that he has a basic salary of Ã¢â€šÂ¬810 GROSS. On Ã¢â€šÂ¬810 gross he still gets a minimum wage supplement of Ã¢â€šÂ¬130.58.\n",
      "But the worker will get all the allowances due to him calculated on Ã¢â€šÂ¬810 gross and not on Ã¢â€šÂ¬940.58.\n",
      "And that is why he is also disadvantaged in the length-of-service allowance:\n",
      "Calculated on 810Ã¢â€šÂ¬ gross length of service:\n",
      "-2% length of service allowance-16,20Ã¢â€šÂ¬ gross\n",
      "-3% length-of-service allowance-Ã¢â€šÂ¬24,30 gross\n",
      "-5% length-of-service increment-40.50Ã¢â€šÂ¬ gross\n",

      "-5% seniority allowance-47,5Ã¢â€šÂ¬ gross\n",
      "Then where are all the other allowances due to the worker, all of which are calculated at Ã¢â€šÂ¬810 gross. This is just an example\n",
      "There are even higher allowances up to the minimum wage\n",
      "It must therefore be legislated immediately that employers are no longer allowed to pay a worker a supplement to the minimum wage, but must pay the worker the minimum wage set by law.\n",
      "Otherwise, all prices have gone up and it will be the little people who will be short-changed again. And the companies will boast about the profits they have made.The current system is that workers must have a medical check-up before starting work. This is great for the worker, but it brings a few complications - no \"today-tomorrow\" employment, not worthwhile for very short-term employment, students have to be managed as a separate group with exceptions, etc.\n",
      "I propose to draw up a list of the jobs that most workers do (standing, sitting, computer work, lifting objects up to 25 kg, etc.) and to have an examination to certify the worker's ability to do all these basic requirements - but this certificate would be valid for three years as before, regardless of the employer (so if you change from one office job to another and you have had an examination a year ago, you do not need a new examination for two years). For occupations with specific requirements (psychological examinations, etc.), an additional examination would be carried out according to the additional requirements of the specific job.\n",
      "For students, such an examination would be carried out as part of the regular systematic examinations already carried out during their studies.\n",
      "This would simplify recruitment for all and reduce unnecessary checks. This would also be the first precondition for putting student work on an equal footing with other forms of work, as this rule would also apply to them in the same way as to others.Road users are required to use vignettes which are divided into toll classes (Class 1, 2A, 2B). Which vehicles belong to which toll classes is often unclear and is left to the interpretation of the regulations, which are unclear or interpreted by DARS employees in their own way, which results in the user not knowing which vignette is appropriate. In view of the problem, this has been partially solved by the list of measured vehicles for classes 2A and 2B and these users are also entitled to reimbursement in case of using the wrong vignette. The problem occurs between Class 1 and 2A, in which case users are not entitled to reimbursement even though the user consults the DARS call centre before purchase and is advised to purchase what turns out to be an inappropriate vignette due to unclear regulations. I suggest that DARS should also list on its website and in a prominent place the measured vehicles for single-track motor vehicles and allow these users to be reimbursed also in case it is unclear which vignette is appropriate for their vehicle. At the same time, this list would be of great help to DARS staff in advising road users.I would also suggest that the government consider addressing the credit issues of the population in these times... the income of the population will be considerably reduced, so I would suggest a solution in the sense of a moratorium on credit repayments for the duration of the epidemic (perhaps extending the period of credit repayments for the duration of the declared crisis - as many months as the instalments are not paid, the credit repayments would be extended by that amount, but in any case not that the time of credit repayments would not be reduced, assuming a moratorium and a consequent increase in the instalment of the credit). Of course, writing off monthly instalments for the time of a declared crisis would not be accepted even in a dream, but given that the banks have in the past received a huge amount of help from the State (the population!!!), perhaps in this situation the banks could also help the population, because in the final analysis, any credit (in terms of interest) will be repaid in full and no more!!!My suggestion is that banks should put a moratorium on credit repayments for a period of, say, 3 months after the end of the epidemic, which would be a very big help to the economy, especially to smaller businesses and sole traders. Since there is a big drop in income, there is a high probability of not paying the annuities on time, charging interest... and the banks will get fat again.I propose that the government issue or simply amend a regulation to ensure that the value of the funds deposited in the bank is maintained at the average rate of return on other assets.\n",
      "Banks charge the cost of maintaining the funds and only charge extremely low interest. Banks lending the same funds charge substantial interest, which includes the depreciation of the money with inflation, and the money lent is not the bank's property but is the property of the depositors and other sources. Banks therefore preserve the value of the borrowed funds, but appropriate the result instead of attributing it to the owners. Most people are not aware of this, and the banks take advantage of it, speculatively defrauding depositors.\n",
      "Inflation is not the only sign of value adjustment. The data on house rents shows that money invested in property returns the purchase price of the house after only three years or less - the smaller flats observed. Profitability without real control by the FURS makes this situation possible, and levelling the playing field for everyone is the basic purpose of any state, which also ensures the economic security of its citizens.Many companies will be forced to lay off workers as a result of revenue shortfalls. In order to mitigate the economic damage and the increase in unemployment, I propose that the government, in addition to other measures, temporarily encourage people to take paid and unpaid leave.\n",
      " \n",
      "Particularly in the case of unpaid leave, the current arrangements are inadequate. Unpaid leave represents a cost for both the employer (social insurance) and the employee (pension, parental care and unemployment insurance). An additional problem is the unnecessary administrative complications, since under the current arrangements the employee's contributions have to be paid by the employer, who then has to claim the money from the employee.\n",
      " \n",
      "I propose that the government simplify and incentivise the use of leave for a limited period. In the case of unpaid leave, I propose that it be made free for the employee and the employer's share reduced to 50%.During the corona virus epidemic, households should be exempted from or partially pay for energy costs (electricity, heating, water, gas).\n",

I believe that the current maximum sentence of 5 years is absolutely too low and does not deter the potential perpetrator from the act itself (as evidenced by the increasingly brazen attacks on officials, especially police officers). I suggest a minimum of 1 year in prison as the minimum possible sentence. In these cases, sentences should not be \"suspended\", and the prison sentence itself should not be reduced (e.g. when the convicted person serves only part of the sentence due to \"good behaviour\"). It would also make sense to introduce, in addition to prison sentences, fines, which should not be less than Ã¢â€šÂ¬1000. When drafting amendments to criminal legislation in this area, the trade unions or associations of the professions concerned should be urgently consulted or involved in the drafting process. The offences in the amended Criminal Code should apply to all offences committed against all the officials mentioned in the Criminal Code (police officers, prosecutors, judges - not just criminal ones!, inspectors, etc.). I further propose to extend the powers of the so called \"judicial police officers\" in the facilities of the judiciary, in the courts... In these facilities, judicial police officers should have all the necessary powers and means of coercion (including weapons and electric stun guns) to carry out the task of guarding the court facilities, the facilities of the prosecutor's office, and perhaps also the Ministry of Justice and the persons employed in these facilities (including prosecutors and judges) - similar to the so-called \"court butler\" in the USA. The security of facilities owned or used by the State authorities, especially those used by the police, the army and the judiciary, should not be provided by private security services, but only by qualified State officials (police officers, soldiers, judicial police officers). The reason for this proposal is, of course, to ensure a certain level of security of these facilities and to ensure the protection of the \"contents\" of these facilities (example - the theft of weapons from the facilities of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior). Knowing that my proposal deals with certain legislative changes that would be \"in favour\" of professions that are not always among the most popular, due to the (also repressive) nature of their work and the attitudes of individuals in the ranks of politicians, I suggest to the \"official readers\" of the proposal from the ranks of the government to consider this proposal anyway, even if it is unlikely to achieve enough \"popular\" votes. Such legislation would allow for greater respect for officials and ensure better exercise of the official powers exercised by individuals in these professions.I propose that all foreign citizens who do not have Slovenian citizenship and are unemployed and receiving social assistance be deported from the Republic of Slovenia to their countries of origin.\n",

Let me also say that my mother and my brother each have their own sole proprietorship and are currently out of work, and consequently out of earnings. I read on the Internet that pensioners and those who already receive social assistance (EUR 400 a month for lying on the sofa???? this does not apply to pensioners) will receive a crisis allowance. I do not understand this, because nothing changes for them, pensioners will still receive their pension, their cost of living will not increase, at most it will decrease, because the government has made the cost of electricity cheaper (commendable). I am not the only student who is without an income (in my case, my mother and brother are also without an income), so I propose, on behalf of everyone, that the extra money that is supposed to be earmarked for pensioners and the socially deprived who are already receiving aid be distributed fairly among the students who have been left without an income. Of course, there are also students who have not worked before, but who are now also finding it harder to support themselves financially, so think of them too. My proposal is really well-intentioned, so that everyone is fairly looked after in these times of crisis, and I realise that it is not easy for you in times like these either, and I support most of the measures that you are taking. Otherwise, I am constantly monitoring the vacancies for students so that they can get into work as soon as possible and secure a monthly income, so that I am not just waiting for the allowances to be handed out by the state. But it is difficult to get a job in this situation.\n",

      "Just because we are hard-working and work more than average than other full-time employees, and are also affected by the current situation and have a reduced volume of work, or, in the meantime, the clients have resigned, we also deserve to receive at least a reduction in contributions and, in the case of demonstrable cases of reduced volume of work, also financial support.\n",

      "Greetings,Hello, I would like to commend the work you have done so far in these times of crisis, but I would also like to make one more suggestion to relieve the burden on all employees, and that is to call on insurance companies to reduce or abolish supplementary health insurance for the duration of the coronary crisis, which for a two-parent family would cost 69 euros.Sir, I propose to the Government that a disabled person with housing credit who is employed for four hours and who is unable to be deployed by his employer during the coronavirus due to a risky illness, should be granted 100% compensation while waiting for work.\n",

This is not a fun exercise, but one of the moves to bring the work of the PSUs closer to the people.I propose that salaried workers should be paid gross, and not just the official (worker's) gross, but the employer's total gross, which means the sum of the net salary, the worker's and employer's contributions and the income tax advance, i.e. the gross gross.\n",
      "It is this total amount that the employer has to pay for the worker's work or as the entire cost of the worker's work. If the worker had not worked, then the employer would not have had this exact cost (the living wage), which means that the amount of the employer's cost of this work depends precisely on the sum of all the individual components listed, i.e. the net wage and all the benefits it gives rise to. There is also no difference between the employee's and the employer's contributions, both of which go to the State budget as revenue and even for the same purposes. It makes no difference whether the employee's salary is, for example, subject to a total of thirty per cent or to a twofold contribution of fifteen per cent for this purpose.\n",
      "What sense, then, does my proposal make?\n",
      "Neither the workers nor the State would have any problems at all any more as a result of non-payment of payroll taxes by employers, since such non-payment would no longer be theoretically possible. Workers would simply and honestly pay their own contributions and taxes on the basis of the wages they receive. Once they have received their full gross wages from their employer, they would pay the relevant taxes and contributions into the relevant accounts at the prescribed rates. To make it easier for them to do this, the employer would of course help them by calculating and writing the amount of the levy on their payslips and handing them the payslips when they are paid. This would leave the workers with the simple task of physically paying them.\n",
      "The employer would then pay the money intended to cover the full cost of his work to the worker who did the work. In this way, it would be impossible for the employer to avoid the levies on which the work is burdened, which can only be to the benefit of the recipient of the taxes and contributions, i.e. the State. Workers would also benefit considerably, since they would never have to claim from their employers for any unpaid contributions.I propose to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia to impose an unconditional punishment (without prior warning, which has no effect anyway) on all those persons who do not comply with the instructions of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia regarding the quarantine imposed for the new Coronavirus.\n",

      "1- The fine should be EUR 1,000, without the possibility of a \"half-payment\".\n",
      "2- The fine should not be paid immediately, but should only become due after 30 days from the receipt of the fine, but only if the recipient of the fine has received another fine for repeated non-compliance with the instructions within this 30-day period.\n",
      "If the recipient of the penalty does not receive a new penalty within 30 days, the recipient does not have to pay the first penalty, as the original penalty is deemed to have expired. Therefore, the first penalty becomes irrelevant.\n",
      "4- The penalty shall be given to all adult persons in the group (and not just one person in the group) who do not comply with the instructions. The penalty for minors is imposed on their guardians.\n",

Law on Social Security Benefits (ZSVarPre), Page 9195.       I would just like to comment on the two controversial paragraphs in the two articles, even though I am not a lawyer by training, but I think with my own head and, because of my own difficult social situation, I inform myself about the legislation that concerns me - I am a literary person who has the will to think.  Article 23, paragraph 5: 5. a private car or a single-passenger vehicle with a value of up to 28 times the basic minimum income, Explanatory note: This Article therefore states that the applicant may have a private car, while he may not have savings. Yes, what about us almost blind people. That is to say, those who are really deprived should also sell their car first and then apply for social assistance. That does not seem logical to me - yes, a car, no savings, not even a thousand euros - is it not highly illogical?  And Article 36, paragraph (7) If a beneficiary of permanent social assistance or a beneficiary who has received social assistance at least twenty-four times in the three years preceding the application is the owner of immovable property, the decision on entitlement to social assistance shall prohibit him from alienating and encumbering the immovable property of which he is the owner in favour of the Republic of Slovenia.  This seems to me to be, in a sense, a gallant undermining of the modest assets of those small farmers who receive social assistance and who, because of their years, find it difficult to find employment and cannot even survive on a modest, almost market-garden farming income. There will simply be a seal, in legal jargon, put on their property. And you think that social workers are going to warn these simple people about what can happen to them, so that they do not simply have to sell or give away their arable land. The law says nothing about what happens to the seal if people's status improves, if they get a job, if they otherwise recover. I doubt that social workers will have the legal knowledge to be able to advise people on how to get their seals removed if they want to sell the property and thus stop receiving social support for a while. I am surprised that the law applies retrospectively, that is to say, to the time when they were receiving this benefit of tenure, that is to say, to the previous three years, when the law was not yet in force and people were not aware of the legal risks of receiving social assistance. I really find this highly controversial, this retroactive intervention, because the general legal principle, supposedly also under the Constitution, is that new situations are taken into account by the adoption of a new law, not by putting the beneficiaries of social transfers in a matt situation. To be poetic: like this, my darlings, you have been eating the State's cock up to now, and you have fields, do you not. Yes, you go on eating the state bread, but the fields will be ours when you growl. So, if such a law and such an article have already been adopted, and this paragraph asserts the right of the State to put a seal on the non-benefits of beneficiaries who are already having their social contribution reduced as a result of the CC, as much as it is, for example, a meagre EUR 71 for me. The law could have defined things differently, for example, those who will henceforth receive three years of uninterrupted social assistance will get a seal on their immovable property. That would make sense to me, rather than requiring things retrospectively. Nobody is accusing the rich of all sorts of machinations, but that is another story, a completely different story. Poor people's property, let it become state property!    Well, I would have thought it quite appropriate that at least somebody should have read this, because it seems to me that there is, after all, enough sensible subtlety in your institution to understand how laws are sometimes made just like that, over the top.     I find it hard to believe that this writing will generate any response, and perhaps someone will just smile and click and share and it will. Anyway, it seems to me that the state should slowly issue a primer: How to use the state, because even soup in a jar has to have an instruction manual, so why shouldn't the state - a bit of a joke, really, a bit of a joke.\n",
      "I WOULD THEREFORE SUGGEST TO THE GOVERNMENT TO SHAKE UP THE LAW ONCE AGAIN WITH THE RIGHT LEGAL OPTICS AND WITH MORE CONSIDERATION FOR THE WEAKEST ...    Have a nice day, I hope it's drier - our socialists are always dry anyway ... !       Bojan BizjakI SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNMENT ALSO TAKE CARE OF A VERY VULNERABLE GROUP OF PEOPLE: PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE WAITING FOR A SUITABLE JOB! In fact, disabled people who are waiting for a suitable (!???) job receive a minimum amount from the disability insurance (PRECISELY the compensation for the time spent waiting for a suitable job), which is around EUR 350. In the Government's latest measure to improve the social situation, there is not a single mention of this group of people. Not now, but in general, this group is completely marginalised. It is not possible to get social assistance, it is not possible to get a care allowance and so on. NOTHING!! Absolutely everybody gets something, only disabled people on the waiting list get nothing! Recently, the government has adopted an increase in the amount of unemployment benefit for those on waiting list(!!!) and in order not to give such disabled people an increase, it has also changed the name of our benefit: no longer a waiting list benefit, but a health insurance benefit. All this in order to deliberately deprive us! Please speed up the process and find a solution as soon as possible!I propose that the government abolish compulsory health insurance contributions from the gross salary and from the gross salary, leaving only the voluntary health insurance we already know as an alternative. We all know that we have a lot of problems in the health sector because of the dissatisfaction of doctors, who are overworked and underpaid for their work. There is also dissatisfaction on the part of clients, who have to suffer long waiting times and are rewarded with annoying doctors. On the other hand, with private doctors, you come straight to the front of the queue, they do the job 200% well and greet you with a smile. So, the state should abolish compulsory health insurance and introduce only voluntary health insurance! Health insurance should be left to insurance companies such as Adriatic Slovenica d.d., Triglav Health Insurance Company d.d. and Vzajemna Health Insurance Company d.v.z.\n",
      "There are many exceptions who could not afford health insurance. These are:\n",
      "- children, pupils and students in full-time education - children and adolescents with physical and mental disabilities - children and adolescents with accidental head injury and brain damage\n",
      "- detainees who are not insured under any other title, convicted persons serving a prison sentence, juvenile prison sentence, juveniles serving an educational measure of detention in a re-education home, persons who have been imposed a precautionary measure of compulsory psychiatric treatment and care in a health care institution, and compulsory treatment for alcohol and drug dependence, - insured persons and their dependants who are not guaranteed payment for health care services, provided that they meet the conditions for obtaining financial social assistance, as determined by the Centre for Social Work.\n",
      "- military invalids and civilian invalids of war, - war veterans and victims of war violence\n",
      "These people should be covered by the state budget, while the rest of the population not listed above should be covered by voluntary health insurance.\n",
      "I ask the portal users and the government to accept my proposal, otherwise, to answer me with counter arguments why my proposal is not appropriate.\n",
      "LpHello.\n",
      "First of all, I would like to thank you because students are/we are being heard. Well, in my case, I can say that they were (full-time students). I am an extraordinary student myself and I know that there are not a few of us and that quite a few of us find ourselves in a very unpleasant situation at the moment. There are quite a few of us who feel that this one-off aid of Ã¢â€šÂ¬150 does not help very much. And there are more. You have forgotten about us - the EXTRAORDINARY students. I have heard comments like \"yes, if they are part-time students it is logical that they have money\". Excuse me? Does anyone ask where we get it? I believe there are many individuals whose parents pay for their studies or at least help them. But on the other hand, there are also those whose parents cannot. Not at all now, in times of epidemic. And who is going to help us? Who are paying for their own studies? When will we also be heard? Not to mention that there are many of us who do not make this our only expense. We also have cars, flats, etc. And no one else will pay for them but ourselves. Well, frankly, Ã¢â€šÂ¬150 wouldn't help me much either, given my monthly expenses, which are about Ã¢â€šÂ¬600. And I know that there are not a few of us like that. But we don't need much! I'd be happy just to have the bills, I don't need the rest, or the luxury can wait until it's over.\n",
      "So, the fact is that there are some students (I know a lot of them myself) who are extending their status, lying at home all day, not working through a student and having zero expenses. And such people should get help? Why already? On the other hand, we have students who work a lot more than a normal worker and do part-time studies on top of that, which is not exactly easy either. And we are not worthy of any help? And because of us who work through the student, there are also student services, which could also do something to help us! Not to mention the educational institutions, which are also working at our expense! We pay too much for these part-time studies anyway, and when we need something, there is no one.\n",
      "Well, I am in favour of proposing that everyone should show the decline in their income and be helped on that basis. Or to show their monthly expenses. The best thing would be to also look at the last 6 or 12 months' earnings.\n",
      "Otherwise, I know that it can never be to everyone's liking! But at least we can be heard and you can't just \"forget\" about us EXTRAORDINARY students!\n",
